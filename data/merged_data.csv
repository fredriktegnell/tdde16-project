Liverpool,0,United,0,Defiant Manchester United keep Liverpool at arm’s length in stalemate,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/17/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-17,"Manchester United returned to the scene of the crime and removed all evidence of the spinelessness and unprofessionalism that besmirched their last appearance at Anfield. Erik ten Hag’s team were defiant, disciplined and unified, everything they were not in the 7-0 rout in fact, in taking a point against Liverpool. United made a point, too: the dressing room still plays for its manager. United became the first team to stop Liverpool winning at Anfield this season and the first to prevent Jürgen Klopp’s side scoring since Chelsea held them to a goalless draw in April. Liverpool could have set a club record of scoring in 35 consecutive games in all competitions but, against a defence marshalled expertly by Raphaël Varane, were found wanting here with the final ball or decision. Diogo Dalot’s dismissal for two shows of dissent in quick succession came too late to take advantage. Klopp disliked the pre-match talk of another Liverpool landslide. He feared, correctly as it transpired, that United would be inspired not scarred by their harrowing Anfield experience last season. He liked the outcome even less as Liverpool’s run of 11 successive home wins was halted by a resolute United performance in front of Anfield’s biggest crowd for more than half a century. An extra 7,000 seats were available in the upper tier of the new Anfield Road stand for the first time. There were an extra 7,000 groans of frustration as Liverpool missed the chance to return to the Premier League summit. For Ten Hag, the 212th meeting between the clubs delivered the reaction he required following after United’s meek midweek exit from the Champions League. It could have been perfect had his visitors capitalised on several promising counter‑attacks in the second half – Rasmus Højlund failed to take the best opening of the match – but there was no denying Liverpool’s overall dominance. The United manager was hindered by an injury list that included three central defenders – Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martínez and Victor Lindelöf. Bruno Fernandes’s suspension and the ill Anthony Martial reduced his options further. Even so, the ramshackle nature of United’s starting lineup and inexperience on their bench reinforced how badly the club has recruited at vast expense in recent years. There was a sense of achievement for the visitors in getting to half-time goalless, although their authority increased as Liverpool’s attempts fell flat. Klopp had vowed that Liverpool would “go for them” in an attempt to prey on any lingering anxieties from the record victory last season. He wasn’t lying. Liverpool won the first corner after 26 seconds. There was a tumultuous roar when Ryan Gravenberch pressed Sofyan Amrabat into submission in a United corner. Højlund had to help Luke Shaw at left‑back long before making his presence felt in the Liverpool half. There was intensity and constant pressure from the home side, forcing United into desperate defensive actions from the first whistle, but too many wayward final balls enabled the visitors to ride the storm in the first half. André Onana escaped when dropping a Ryan Gravenberch header under pressure to Mohamed Salah, and reacting to turn his scrambled shot wide, but was only seriously tested by Virgil van Dijk’s header from Trent Alexander-Arnold’s corner. The United keeper tipped over from close range. Onana’s biggest contribution was to the palpitations among the away fans whenever playing out with his feet. The lack of composure in Liverpool’s first-half performance was encapsulated by the first booking of the contest for Darwin Núñez. The Uruguay international raised an arm into the chest of Jonny Evans when pursuing a long ball out of defence and was booked for kicking the ball away after the blatant free-kick was awarded. He then sarcastically applauded the assistant referee. The foul on Evans was more deserving of a yellow card than the offence for which Núñez was cautioned. Dalot’s dismissal for two bookable offences in the same incident, when he rightly argued for a United throw-in, was harsh in comparison. United were reliant on the counterattack to hurt Liverpool. They might have succeeded with more quality, confidence and intelligence in their front line, particularly in the second half when the visitors had ample opportunity to expose Liverpool’s defence. Antony was again infuriatingly wasteful, quicker to blame others for his mistakes than to spot the right pass. The largely anonymous Alejandro Garnacho was played through by a delightful ball from Kobbie Mainoo but unable to hold off Alexander-Arnold as he entered the penalty area. The Liverpool vice-captain intervened with a vital touch. Antony was involved in a flowing United move that ended with Scott McTominay, captain in the absence of Fernandes, releasing Højlund behind Van Dijk. The chance to open his United league account when and where it really mattered presented itself to Højlund but Alisson blocked well with his chest and gathered the follow-up. Klopp’s team continued to pose the greater threat, however. Alexander-Arnold placed a shot inches wide from 25 yards with Onana stranded. The Cameroon international produced an assured second‑half performance, saving confidently from Salah, Ibrahima Konate and Nunez. United also survived a VAR review for handball against Shaw after Kostas Tsimikas’s cross bounced up on to the defender’s arm off his thigh. Dalot made a superb intervention to prevent Luis Díaz sweeping home from close range and, despite losing his cool to reduce United to 10 men, there was no fresh torment for Ten Hag at Anfield. United must build on this foundation."
Brentford,1,Villa,2,Ollie Watkins seals furious comeback win for Aston Villa at Brentford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/17/brentford-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-17,"Having blown open the Premier League title race, can Aston Villa sustain their own challenge? Brentford seemed to have brought Villans’ dreaming to a halt, as Thomas Frank’s team first dulled their attack and then scored through Keane Lewis-Potter. But once reduced to 10 men after Ben Mee’s red card, they could not resist Villa’s surges and self-belief. Aston Villa thus celebrate a first win at Brentford since February 1953, the same week Disney released the original Peter Pan feature-length cartoon. A first Villa title challenge of the 21st century is no fairy story, although this encounter featured x-rated tackles, 10 outfield bookings and three off-field amid repeated heavy aggro, including during the celebrations of Ollie Watkins’s winner against his former club. The game concluded as Boubacar Kamara was dismissed following a ruck started by Emi Martínez’s bundling of Neal Maupay to the floor. Players and coaches piled in. Unai Emery made a beeline for Martínez but did not prevent Kamara’s shove on Yegor Yarmolyuk. “I was trying to calm the players down,” said Villa’s manager, booked for his peacekeeping. “I’m trying to speak with him,” he said of Martínez, the goalkeeper having kept his team in the game. “He had a fantastic match.” Afterwards, Watkins similarly sought to cool waters, explaining his celebration. “It all spurred from my celebration but that’s not down to a lack of respect for the fans,” he said. “I love the club, the players and staff, I’ve not got a bad word to say against them. But there was one person who was abusing me all game.” The suggestion from the Villa camp was the abuser had spoken ill of Watkins’s family. “I know Ollie as a person of top integrity,” Frank said, equally diplomatic. Brentford are racked with injuries with Bryan Mbeumo’s absence until beyond the Africa Cup of Nations a particularly acute problem even if one of Frank’s best assets as a manager is responding to setbacks. He particularly enjoys doing so by beating clubs with eyes on haughtier targets but what looked a likely coup became a fifth defeat in six. “They gave everything,” he said of his team. Taking a dim view of the scenes at the end, he criticised his players though was clearly equally unhappy with Villa’s behaviour. “But it’s important we show class.” Until Mee’s dismissal the signs were that Villa, for all this season’s advancements, lack strength in depth. Leon Bailey, outstanding in keynote defeats of both Manchester City and Arsenal and eventually key to victory, was fit only for the bench and two previous ever-presents in Douglas Luiz and Lucas Digne were serving suspensions. From the kick-off Brentford, no slouches in pressing, were confined to their defensive third. Still, that left space for counterattacks and it took Martínez’s brilliant reaction save from Mikkel Damsgaard to prevent an early Bees lead. Brentford had a penalty shout declined when John McGinn appeared to wrench Mee to the floor in an act of Glaswegian affection that foreshadowed the later ugly scenes. “I thought there were three mistakes today,” Frank said. “Sometimes you feel unfairly treated but you have to move forward.” In the stands, sat with his fellow absentee Rico Henry, Ivan Toney doubtless wondered what hay he could make from a Villa defence offering much with which to work. Away from home, Villa’s mistakes have been far more prevalent – and costly – than at fortress Villa Park. On the stroke of half-time, Lewis-Potter took full advantage of such slackness. The ball bounced variously from the orbits of Kamara, Watkins and a flailing Álex Moreno before the former Hull player waited for Saman Ghoddos’s corner to score a first Premier League goal. Villa began the second half beating at the door of a retrenched Brentford, Emery twisting himself in knots on the touchline. It took Mee’s dismissal to turn the game Villa’s way. A high tackle on Bailey was both a tactical foul to stop the forward escaping and a rake of the Jamaican’s shins. Mee made himself ready to depart as soon as the referee, David Coote, was called to the video screen. Frank asked: “Do we want a physical contact sport or not?” His mood turned yet more purple when the substitute Maupay was baulked by Ezri Konsa and yet neither Coote nor the VAR, Craig Pawson, deemed that worthy of a penalty. Soon enough Bailey helped to bring Villa level, finding Moreno at the back post, and tensions began to brim over – Frank taking particular exception to Austin MacPhee, Villa’s lank-locked set-piece coach. That it was a corner that brought Villa their late winner probably only added to Frank’s agitation. Jacob Ramsey took it, and Kamara’s back-heel found Watkins to nod in and celebrate in the uncharacteristic goading fashion he later had to explain. Villa’s impossible dream endures, though they lived on their nerves to keep it that way."
West Ham,3,Wolves,0,Mohammed Kudus magic silences Wolves as West Ham find home comfort,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/17/west-ham-wolves-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-17,"The stadium announcer described him before kick‑off as a “wizard” and Mohammed Kudus certainly has magic in his boots at the moment. Two goals in the space of 10 first‑half minutes from the Ghana forward inspired West Ham to a fourth successive home victory that leaves David Moyes’s side clutching the coat-tails of the Premier League’s top six. Kudus, who joined from Ajax in the summer for £38m, now has nine goals for West Ham including four in his past three appearances here at a stadium quickly becoming his spiritual home. The only issue for Moyes will be how to replace him next month during the Africa Cup of Nations. “It’s a huge blow for us – he is great to work with,” the West Ham manager said. “He scores goals and makes goals and he’s doing all the work for us as well. We are going to have to find other ways. We’ll hugely miss him.” Gary O’Neil’s battling Wolves team were denied a goal by the finest of margins courtesy of VAR but they were no match for Kudus and his co‑tormentor Lucas Paquetá, who provided assists for both opening goals and set up Jarrod Bowen’s clincher with 16 minutes to play. “It’s great credit to our forward players – that’s what Lucas Paquetá can do for us,” Moyes said. “I’m pulling my hair out half the time and the other half I’m celebrating because he’s making passes that a lot of people can’t see.” While West Ham’s victory against Freiburg on Thursday was their 10th successive home win in European competition, things have not been so straightforward in the Premier League this season. Before this game, Moyes’s team had picked up more points on the road despite the 5-0 hammering at Fulham last weekend and started here like they intended to consign that performance to history. Dan Bentley – brought in to replace José Sá in the Wolves goal with the usual No 1 nursing a shoulder injury – survived an aerial bombardment inside the first 10 minutes courtesy of some pinpoint deliveries from James Ward-Prowse and Bowen. Wolves showed a glimpse of their threat on the break when Matheus Cunha forced Lukasz Fabianski into a simple save and almost took the lead 15 seconds before Kudus found the breakthrough at the other end. Craig Dawson’s header from a corner was going just wide but still needed Emerson to deal with the danger, with Edson Álvarez finding Paquetá in space before Kudus did the rest after cutting inside on to his favoured left foot. It was a stunning strike that left Bentley grasping at thin air. Fabianksi was at full stretch to save another effort from Cunha as Wolves attempted to strike back but the visitors soon found themselves two goals down. Kurt Zouma intercepted a pass from Mario Lemina and once again it was Paquetá’s vision that opened the door to allow Kudus to finish with aplomb, this time with his right foot. “We were nowhere near good enough,” said O’Neil, who blamed the defeat on “disastrous decision‑making” for West Ham’s opening two goals. “Hopefully when we get a few more players back we will give a better account of ourselves.” Wolves had found the net in every match this campaign since their controversial defeat against Manchester United on the opening weekend but could not find a way back into the game this time. They could have been three down at the break had Bowen’s shot not smacked off the post moments after the West Ham forward felt he had been brought down in the area. Emotions momentarily got the better of O’Neil just before half-time when he was booked after protesting when Vladimir Coufal was not sanctioned for seeming to use his forearm in a heavy challenge on Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. “Over the course of the game I thought his challenges warranted two yellows and the fact he wasn’t booked for that challenge was strange,” the Wolves manager insisted. O’Neil was back prowling the touchline at the start of the second half in the hope of rousing a comeback from his team, with Tomas Soucek blocking a goalbound shot from Hwang Hee-chan. The lifeline they craved seemed to arrive when Pablo Sarabia touched home a cross from Nélson Semedo but after a long delay VAR deemed the Spaniard to be marginally offside. O’Neil could barely believe his bad luck. Another Cunha shot whistled over the crossbar from a tight angle but the game was up when Bowen picked up the ball in his own half and played a one-two with Paquetá. Suddenly the West Ham forward found himself in acres of space and there was only ever going to be one outcome as he slid the ball past Bentley to seal a comfortable win for the hosts before Kudus and Paquetá left the field to a richly deserved standing ovation."
Arsenal,2,Brighton,0,Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus deliver goods as Arsenal sink Brighton to go top,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/17/arsenal-brighton-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-17,"At the end of this controlled, arm’s-length victory against a defanged Brighton there was a sense once again of this Arsenal team operating in a kind of stealth mode. Defeat against Brighton here in May had effectively ended Arsenal’s hopes of winning the league last season. This time around second‑half goals from Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz lifted Mikel Arteta’s team back to the top of the table. Afterwards Arteta spoke about things like maturity and game intelligence. Roberto De Zerbi was more effusive: “Arsenal are the best team we have played so far this season. We are not used to suffering in this way. We are used to controlling the game.” Control is the key word. There has been a less emotionally draining pitch about Arsenal’s progress so far this year after the adrenal highs of last season, the talk of collapse, of being, of all things, “too emotional” in the final knockings (never mind losing your best defender or being reeled in by one of the great club teams: emotion is definitely a better story). Even the celebrations at the end here were relatively contained, Martin Ødegaard restricting himself to a rather mannered fist-pump toward the home end. Sporting narrative is always entirely outcome-based. This kind of victory will either become evidence of a team ready to win titles or evidence of a team still looking for fluency. Take your pick and count backwards from the end. For now Arteta and his players will be delighted with the routine, energy-saver feel of a 12th league victory of the season. This is a relatively novel fixture, to the extent Arteta has been on the touchline for more than a third of all Arsenal versus Brighton games ever. Even in that limited time Brighton have still been able to attain mild bogey-team status, although here they always looked to be feeling the burn from their Europa League win against Marseille on Thursday. The key moment arrived just after half-time, as Arsenal re-emerged predictably geed up after dominating territory and possession without any real sense of devil. Havertz and Ødegaard pushed higher up the pitch. Suddenly there were overlaps and half-chances. But the opening goal still came from the latest in a series of knife-edge Brighton passing moves inside their own box. Jack Hinshelwood won the ball back from Bukayo Saka deep on the right flank. At which point the Brighton defence enacted a startlingly intricate passing zigzag across the penalty area, no doubt with the intention of sucking Arsenal in, avoiding the counter-press and so on, but they were hurried and harried and ended up conceding a needless corner. Saka took it. The ball swung violently in towards goal and flicked off the top of Jan Paul van Hecke’s head. Unmarked, Jesus stooped to nod it into the net. From there Arsenal were able to sit a little deeper. Declan Rice controlled the angles in midfield. Ødegaard had a fine game and produced the pass of the afternoon in the first half, a stunned, back-spun, curving piece of stage direction, eased into the tiniest channel of space to put Saka in on goal, only for Gabriel Martinelli to scoop the cut‑back over the bar. The Emirates Stadium had been a chilly, drab, Sunday-ish place at kick‑off. Arsenal were unchanged from the defeat at Villa Park last weekend. De Zerbi was forced to persist with James Milner at left‑back. It took 50 seconds for Saka to engineer his first odd-couple duel down that flank, although to Milner’s credit he battled away all afternoon, an act of will as opposed to any great defensive technique, whirling about staunching the danger like a tugboat captain in a storm. Arsenal had control without penetration in the first half, Rice easing about like a triple-masted galleon in midfield. The only real incident of note involved Arteta himself. Fresh from walking away a free man on the steps of the highest VAR court in the land, he was booked just before half-time for another moment of sideline rage. Kaoru Mitoma had pulled Saka back. Arteta responded by leaping about weirdly with both hands in the air, like a man on a desert island spying a sail just as it fades over the horizon. It seemed pointless and performative. The foul had been given. There was no logical reason to go full touchline-disco. Brighton did have their chances. Pascal Gross might have equalised 10 minutes before the end but poked his shot wide from four yards out. Moments later Havertz sealed the game with a fine finish after another rapier break down the left flank. Havertz had spent much of the autumn running on sympathy and pity-penalties. Here he picked up Arsenal’s player of the month award before kick-off, posing a little awkwardly with the trophy (unless specifically stated otherwise Havertz is always doing things a little awkwardly. This is a footballer who can win the Champions League a little awkwardly). The goal was his fourth in the past four weeks, the victory Arsenal’s seventh in nine since defeat at Newcastle."
Burnley,0,Everton,2,Everton pile misery on Burnley as old boy Michael Keane caps off win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/16/burnley-everton-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-16,"Turf Moor has witnessed this template for victory by a Sean Dyche team dozens of times but unfortunately for Burnley he is not their manager any more. Everton were organised, physically dominant and enjoyed goals from players over 6ft to secure a fourth straight victory without conceding, to place them seven points clear of the relegation zone, despite their 10-point deduction, as the siege mentality continues to grow. Amadou Onana and Michael Keane settled the result on a night of nostalgia for Burnley fans, but it was never in doubt as Everton provided 90 minutes of know-how and effective football, while Burnley’s naivety was laid bare by the man with a pub named after him around the corner. In normal circumstances, Everton would sit ninth, an indication of the turnaround under Dyche over the past 11 months. “There is a lot of work to be done because of the penalty,” Dyche said. “I am very pleased with the players’ attitude towards it. You have to find ways of winning games and I think that is an improvement with their understanding.” No one needed to be told who had left the tunnel when the roar went up. Dyche was striding across the pitch for the umpteenth time of his managerial career but for the first time since his final home game as Burnley manager, a 3-2 victory over Everton in April 2022, after almost 10 years in Lancashire. “I had a fantastic time here and if I paid my bit back, that’s how it should be. It is nice to enjoy that moment,” he said. “It was a rare one where the manager gets respect, hopefully from the Evertonians, but the Burnley fans as well.” The opening goal was pure Dyche as the former Claret Dwight McNeil swung a corner to the back post where Onana produced a towering header as James Trafford flapped. For all of Burnley’s nice ideas in possession, Everton were showing efficiency is more effective. It was nostalgic viewing for the home supporters as they got to witness a highly disciplined team with James Tarkowski and Keane at centre-back. The two combined for Everton’s second as the former headed a free-kick down to the latter on the edge of the box; Keane’s first shot was blocked by Trafford but ricocheted back into the defender’s path off Dara O’Shea, allowing him to tap home from six yards. Two assists and a goal for the old boys will not have cheered the fans of the Premier League’s second-bottom club. “There is not much I can say about the overall defending or attacking, it is about both boxes today,” Vincent Kompany said. “We conceded two set plays and the moments we had, we were not able to finalise anything. Getting done in both boxes is what you are left to discuss. It is a credit to Everton, they are one of the best in the league [at set pieces].” Inspired by Lyle Foster’s return for his first appearance in almost two months, after being given time off to deal with mental-health issues, Burnley were more energetic after the break. They looked dangerous on both flanks to cause Everton problems and eventually forced a save when Zeki Amdouni rifled a shot from distance towards the top corner, Jordan Pickford tipping it wide. Dyche was happy to let Burnley pass the ball around because he was confident they did not have the ability to penetrate his back five and he was proved right. It was Everton’s eighth victory of the season where they have had the minority of possession, while Burnley succumbed to their eighth home defeat. Dyche showed once again why he is the king of Turf Moor to make it a night of dejection in the Royal Dyche."
City,2,Palace,2,Olise’s late penalty caps Crystal Palace comeback to frustrate Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/16/manchester-city-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-16,"Phil Foden will not wish to see a replay of the hoof that struck Jean-Philippe Mateta’s shin and felled him in Manchester City’s penalty area and led Paul Tierney to point to the spot deep in added time. The referee was correct: Foden’s agricultural challenge was a cast-iron penalty and so up stepped Michael Olise with cucumber cool to roll the ball to Edison’s right for the equaliser, City’s goalkeeper guessing the wrong way. This sealed the proverbial nightmare for Foden, whose anguish was deepened by him ceding possession for the Palace sequence that led to the penalty. The video assistant referee checked Tierney’s decision – possibly for a push on Foden – but the penalty stood and after the restart Palace again roved up the champions’ end and might have grabbed the winner, City thwarting a late, late corner. It was, though, a classic rope-a-dope comeback from the visitors, who in the 76th minute were 2-0 behind. At that juncture Jack Grealish’s first-half strike had appeared to send City on their Saturday night flight to the Club World Cup in the rosiest of moods as for the first time he had scored in three successive Premier League games. This impressed the watching Gareth Southgate, as did Rico Lewis, whose scent for a scoring zone had him deep in Palace’s area to hammer in City’s second on 54 minutes, a sublime touch from a third England man, Foden, creating this. Foden also fashioned their opener on a good day for Southgate to be here, as Marc Guéhi had a lead part in Palace’s first when lifting a sweet 60-yard ball into Jeffrey Schlupp, who outpaced Rúben Dias and slid the ball over from the left for Mateta to beat Ederson at close range. Palace’s completion of the comeback means City could be up to 12 points behind the leaders, Liverpool, by the next time they play – on 27 December, at Everton – owing to their Club World Cup commitments. On Tuesday, at 7pm at Saudi Arabia’s Prince Abdullah Al Faisal Stadium, Pep Guardiola’s side take on Urawa Red Diamonds, of Japan’s J-League, in their semi-final and will have to shake off this disappointment quickly. Palace’s dying-moments effort is the latest to frustrate City – the count now standing at five games in which they have conceded from the 80th minute onwards. The 3-3 draw with Tottenham here at the start of the month featured an added-time leveller from Dejan Kulusevski. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s finish for Liverpool the week before with 10 minutes remaining meant a share of the points for the visitors, too. This followed Cole Palmer’s last-gasp penalty for Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the previous league game for another draw. On 8 October Gabriel Martinelli’s 86th-minute finish consigned City to defeat at Arsenal. Even before Mateta’s tap-in, Guardiola’s agitation was tangible on the touchline as he observed his men easing off, the manager later saying his frustration was accentuated by Palace having few chances apart from those for their goals. It was no surprise that the arch-pragmatist Roy Hodgson left the attacking zest of Eberechi Eze on the bench, though it was a shame for those who appreciate the defensive arts less. Palace’s manager, of course, has to do what he has to do and so a five-man rearguard was configured and, when possible, Olise was asked to push up in support of the lone striker, Mateta. In the final analysis Hodgson was vindicated, for which he deserves plaudits. Yet for long passages the contest was all about City breaching the visitors. The sight of their sky blue shirts in fluid motion has been rarer recently but for three-quarters of the match the champions were close to their best form. A move down City’s right in which Kyle Walker caressed the ball on to Julián Álvarez’s head and that ended with a Dean Henderson dive-and-tip-away augured well. So, too, an equally liquid sequence along the same flank, when Bernardo Silva prodded the ball inside, Lewis helped it on and Rodri’s shot ricocheted off Guéhi. This came after Dias’s slicing diagonal had missed narrowly to Henderson’s right. Grealish’s goal was City at their slickest and quickest. A short pass from the eventual scorer near Palace’s 18-yard line went to Dias, who found Foden in a thicket of players around the D. A cheeky sidefoot through Joel Ward’s legs sprung Grealish, whose finish was unerring. Lewis’s first league goal should really have killed off Palace. But, as Guardiola bemoaned, if a penalty is given away in the manner of Foden then you do not deserve to win. Now, it is to Saudi Arabia for their mission to become world champions."
Newcastle,3,Fulham,0,Newcastle sink 10-man Fulham after Lewis Miley’s first senior goal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/16/newcastle-fulham-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-16,"Who knows what might have happened if Fulham’s Raúl Jiménez had not been sent off, somewhat contentiously, midway through the first half but an initially fragile Newcastle ultimately made the most of their numerical advantage. Well before the end the psychological damage sustained by Eddie Howe’s team during a preceding trio of consecutive defeats looked, if not quite fully repaired, decently patched up. Along the way to a win which lifts Newcastle to sixth place, the 17-year-old midfielder Lewis Miley scored his first senior goal in the course of an outstanding all round performance after stepping off the bench to replace the injured Joelinton. “To have that composure to score a massive goal in front of the Gallowgate End is something else,” said Howe. “ What I like most about Lewis is his emotionless persona on the pitch. He doesn’t beat himself up when things go wrong and he didn’t get carried away after he scored either. That’s the hallmark of a great player.” While Howe was forced to re-arrange his back four after Fabian Schär hobbled off in the 14th minute Marco Silva found himself making a rather more significant, thoroughly unwanted, re-shuffle from 4-2-3-1 to 4-4-1 after Jiménez launched into a high, wild, studs up, karate style, challenge on Sean Longstaff which concluded with Fulham’s key striker catching the midfielder in the head with a hip. It seemed Jiménez had lost all semblance of control, let alone poise, in the wake of being caught in the face by a stray elbow belonging to Jamaal Lascelles. “It was a clear elbow from Lascelles, he knew Raúl was there,” said Silva pointedly, before courting an FA misconduct charge by suggesting that the referee, Sam Barrott, was not sufficiently experienced. “This was the best example of a referee who did not have the experience to handle the pressure of the home crowd here.” Although Barrott, initially issued a yellow card – perhaps on the basis that Jiménez did appear to be attempting to pull out at the last moment and had made sure he was no longer leading with his foot – a VAR review prompted the official to change his mind. “Raúl jumped into the player but it’s not something serious, you don’t see something wrong with the other player,” said Silva. “A yellow card was right, I don’t know if VAR are trying to justify their job but a red card felt strange.” If the Newcastle fans’ consensus was that it had been a case of VAR, for once, working perfectly, their team continued to creak as the memories of those three defeats against Everton, Spurs and Milan loomed large and Howe’s treatment room gained another patient when Joelinton limped off. By now Fulham had regrouped and, as if temporarily defying gravity, started giving Newcastle a few real counterattacking frights. Silva’s side last won away in the Premier League on the season’s opening weekend but they had scored 10 goals in their past two games, dictating that even Jiménez’s dismissal could not quite remove the swagger from their often impressively inventive step. If Alex Iwobi, now Silva’s emergency lone striker, had been wearing his shooting boots they might even have taken a first-half lead but, despite blowing that highly inviting chance Iwobi held the ball up impressively playing a big part in keeping his side in the game until almost the hour mark. Ditto Bernd Leno. Fulham’s goalkeeper was increasingly involved as Newcastle attacked with second half menace. One save, made one handed from Anthony Gordon – who had earlier hit the bar – was particularly good but even Leno had no answer to Miley when, he seized a loose ball and lashed it low, right footed and unerringly into the far bottom corner after the excellent Bruno Guimarães unhinged Silva’s defence. The Brazilian performed wonders to beat a trio of tight markers before seeing his attempt at an ensuing shot to ricochet kindly for Miley to become Newcastle’s youngest Premier League goalscorer. Miguel Almirón soon doubled that advantage, pouncing on another loose ball to shoot home from close range after Antonee Robinson had sent Callum Wilson crashing in the area. Following a short hiatus while VAR checked for a possible offside against Wilson, a goal created by Gordon’s initial through pass stood. Dan Burn added a third when, despite Leno managing to block his initial header on the line, he made no mistake with the rebound. All that remained was for a smile of pure joy to spread across Miley’s face as Howe hugged him at the final whistle."
Chelsea,2,Sheffield,0,Cole Palmer and Nicolas Jackson on target as Chelsea see off Sheffield United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/16/chelsea-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-16,"This unconvincing win over the worst side in the Premier League may not have arrived had Mauricio Pochettino not reacted to his attack’s repeated ineffectiveness against a low block by altering Cole Palmer’s position after a dire first half, a subtle shift that finally gave Chelsea the possibility to punish Sheffield United with their individual quality. There was more dynamism with Palmer giving up his initial role as a No 10, Raheem Sterling joining Nicolas Jackson in the middle and Chelsea reconfigured in a 4-4-2 system. For Pochettino, a manager under pressure after two dispiriting defeats, it was important to summon the tactical expertise to stop the game becoming an ordeal. In the end he could be satisfied after a seven-minute burst from Palmer, who broke the deadlock before making Jackson’s goal, carried Chelsea up to 10th place and left Chris Wilder bemoaning the defending that ended United’s limited gameplan. Even so, this was not a performance that should lure Pochettino into thinking a charge up the table is on the way. Chelsea are still not showing enough aggression on the ball. It has cost them against better sides than United, who remain five points off 17th place after failing to build on beating Brentford, and will probably do so again unless they learn how to blow limited opponents away early on. “The team in the first half was a little bit frustrated because we didn’t find the way to break the low block,” Pochettino said. “In the second half we fixed different positions and started to find different possibilities. We suffered a lack of aggression in the first half as we made a mistake in the way we tried to penetrate. In the second half we changed the team and found better solutions.” Chelsea may have been depleted but they were still strong enough to leave their £106.8m midfielder, Enzo Fernández, on the bench until the 69th minute. While Pochettino has talked about wanting more signings in January, he would be pushing it if he claims that depth is an issue. In truth the real problem for Chelsea during a sterile opening period was their inability to do anything with all their possession. The lowlight, Mykhailo Mudryk nutmegging Jayden Bogle before shooting embarrassingly wide from a ridiculous angle, summed it up. Jackson also found new and interesting ways to stray offside. Chelsea were blunt, their threat limited to a couple of efforts from Conor Gallagher and Jackson, who would also fail to reach a pass from Moisés Caicedo before United’s goalkeeper, Wes Foderingham. United, however, lacked ambition. The only scare for Chelsea came when Cameron Archer’s deflected shot flew narrowly wide. Chelsea began the second half with more urgency. Realising that Vini Souza had stopped Palmer from getting on the ball, Pochettino moved the playmaker to the right and told Sterling and Jackson to stretch the visitors. It soon made a difference. With 54 minutes gone Palmer dropped a shoulder and played a reverse pass to Sterling. He drove down the right, past Andre Brooks and crossed for Palmer to beat Foderingham from close range. “Just a mad 15 minutes for us at the start of the second half, where our naivety shone through as a young, inexperienced team,” Wilder said. “I thought we were in a good place until half-time. I sensed the feeling inside the ground.” The tension faded after Chelsea’s opener. Palmer came to life again, dribbling in from the right before Gallagher and Sterling forced their way past some meek challenges. Sterling shot, Foderingham clawed the ball away and Palmer’s cutback gave Jackson a tap-in. That was pretty much that. United’s reply was limited to Gustavo Hamer testing Djordje Petrovic with a curling free-kick. The goalkeeper, making his full debut with Robert Sánchez injured, responded with a fine leaping save and Chelsea were able to win consecutive home games in the league for the first time since October 2022."
Forest,0,Spurs,2,Kulusevski leads way as 10-man Spurs deepen gloom for Nottingham Forest,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/15/nottingham-forest-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-15,"After Dejan Kulusevski thumped in Tottenham’s second goal, the killer blow for Nottingham Forest, Steve Cooper swivelled on his feet, dragged his fingers down his cheeks and retreated towards the home dugout. Quite how many more times Cooper will be able to call this place home depends on how dimly the Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, views this latest defeat, a fifth in the past six matches. By the time Bournemouth depart the City Ground on 23 December Forest could, if results do not go their way, find themselves in the relegation zone. Forest have won one of their past 13 matches and Cooper is on increasingly rocky terrain. Spurs finished with 10 men, Yves Bissouma seeing red for a crude takedown of Ryan Yates with 20 minutes to play, but goals from Richarlison and Kulusevski ensured successive victories for Ange Postecoglou’s side. The last time Richarlison managed back-to-back league goals, his manager was Frank Lampard and Donny van de Beek and Dele Alli were among his Everton clubmates. Richarlison is only one more goal away from doubling last season’s tally in all competitions, after his fifth of the campaign here. “Richarlison is a goalmouth monster,” Postecoglou said. “I’m really pleased with him in training and I was confident that he could go out there and do a job for us. He is in a better space physically and mentally. It was hard for him [last season] but he soldiered on. He is definitely feeling a lot better about himself.” A minute before kick-off Cooper patrolled the perimeter of his technical area, acknowledging the home supporters ceaselessly singing his name. Forty-one seconds into the match, another rendition. For Miltiadis Marinakis, the only Marinakis present on the night, it was another reminder – not that the hierarchy needed one – of the Forest manager’s standing among supporters. While the board seem unconvinced on Cooper, there are few doubts among the fanbase. They have 14 points from 17 matches – the same tally as this stage last season – but expectations have heightened after investing heavily in the summer. Postecoglou knows all about that after Spurs’ dream-like start to the season. Brennan Johnson, who joined Forest aged eight but left for Spurs for a club-record £47.5m in September, went close to scoring against his boyhood club before being forced off with a head injury approaching the half-hour. An off-balance Kulusevski moseyed forward and located Johnson, who toe-poked a first-time effort towards the far pocket of the Forest goal but Matt Turner pushed the ball round his right post and to safety. There was little in the way of slick football from Forest, who stuck with the 3-5-2 they switched to last time out, but their pragmatic approach almost paid dividends. Moussa Niakhaté, the Forest centre-back, launched a throw into the box and Willy Boly kept the ball alive but Cheikhou Kouyaté, with only Guglielmo Vicario to beat, handled at the crucial moment. A few minutes later Johnson limped off and was given a warm ovation by both sets of fans. Cooper and Postecoglou embraced the 22-year-old on his way towards the tunnel. Soon after, Yates, another Nottingham boy, made a thudding block to prevent Ben Davies hoicking the ball upfield and responded by asking the fans to turn up the volume. Yet there seemed an air of inevitability that, sooner or later, Spurs would strike. Kulusevski whipped a devilish ball, with pace, towards Forest’s six-yard box and Boly failed to sniff out the danger, allowing Richarlison to glance in and beat Turner to the punch. Forest had a golden chance to earn a route back into the game early in the second half but, unfortunately for Cooper, it fell to probably the last player he would have wished. Anthony Elanga chipped a pass to an unmarked Boly inside the box but the defender spooned his effort over the bar, to the relief of the Spurs defence guilty of getting sucked in towards the ball. Elanga swept Neco Williams’s cross into the net on 58 minutes but Spurs’ high line came to the rescue, a VAR review showing he was one of a quartet of Forest players caught offside. “We can’t carry on being shoulda, coulda, woulda,” Cooper said. “We have to stay together. The job means the world to me. I wish it was different, in terms of the results. I know there are talking points around me – I wish that wasn’t the case and we were talking about more points, more wins and the players.” Twenty minutes into the second half, the sucker punch arrived. Turner kicked carelessly, straight to Kulusevski in the right channel and the Swede preyed on the Forest goalkeeper’s error. Kulusevski drove at Niakhaté, sashayed on to his right foot and blasted at goal, leathering a strike through the gloves of Turner, who will not want to watch a replay anytime soon."
Spurs,4,Newcastle,1,Richarlison doubles up as Tottenham run riot against sorry Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/10/tottenham-newcastle-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-10,"Tottenham scored first. Obviously. It was a moment to remember for Destiny Udogie, his first goal for the club and, at that point in the 26th minute, the scene was set. In each of their previous five Premier League games, Spurs had scored first only to lose four and draw one. It was an unprecedented series of collapses. Could they finally capitalise from a position of strength? Ange Postecoglou’s players gave the answer that he wanted. Of course they could, mate. On an occasion of great significance for the Champions League qualification places, Spurs simply blew Newcastle away, Son Heung-min the star turn, with Richarlison not too far behind. Son finished with the goal that he deserved, swept home from the penalty spot after he had been upended by the Newcastle goalkeeper, Martin Dubravka. But it was the Spurs captain’s assists for the first two goals, the second turned home by Richarlison, that made the difference. Son now has 10 goals and four assists in the Premier League this season. Richarlison heard one of the loudest cheers of the day when he was substituted towards the end. He had added a well-taken second goal and only the hardest of hearts could not smile, given his injuries and mental health issues this season. Newcastle were determined to bounce back from the midweek defeat at Everton but their away-day woes continued, a stoppage-time goal by Joelinton the most hollow of consolations. They have taken only five points on their travels – Eddie Howe said it was indefensible – and it feels as though his injury-ravaged squad is running on fumes. Next up for them is the make-or-break Champions League game at home against Milan on Wednesday. It had been billed in some quarters as the selection crisis derby and the scoreline in terms of unavailable players was 10-8 to Newcastle. There was a sliver of good news for Howe when he was able to recall Sean Longstaff and Callum Wilson to the substitutes’ bench and he would get them both on. That said, for the fifth time in 15 days he went with the same 10 outfield players at the start. Postecoglou has said on numerous occasions that he is “unwavering” in his commitment to the way he wants to play. As such, it was not even a surprise when he sent out an ultra-attacking lineup, Richarlison recalled at the expense of Giovani Lo Celso, Pape Sarr back, too, with Dejan Kulusevski shifted again into a central attacking midfield role. Postecoglou knows it will work. He keeps on saying so. The big tactical tweak was Richarlison in the No 9 role, with Son wide left. It is fair to say that it worked. Spurs pushed up, as always, the full-backs daringly high, and it was possible to wonder whether Newcastle could profit from any quick counter-presses. They nearly did on 10 minutes, Joelinton getting Anthony Gordon into yards of space up the inside-left. When Gordon crossed low for Alexander Isak, Ben Davies stretched to get a faint but decisive defensive touch. That was about as close as it got to Newcastle being in the contest. They were desperately disappointing and the game became a story of Spurs asserting themselves at the other end. Strongly. They brought the energy and much of their pass‑and‑move stuff was extremely slick. Newcastle gasped for breath and it was easy to imagine Howe wincing as several of his players grabbed various body parts and went down, particularly in the early running. Son versus the Newcastle right‑back, Kieran Trippier, was the key duel and there was only one winner. Son had too much speed and trickery and, for Trippier, it was another difficult game after his disastrous performance at Everton. He was booked for kicking Kulusevski and will be suspended for the home game against Fulham on Saturday. Cristian Romero had seen a header from a corner hacked clear by Miguel Almirón on the line when Son, who Postecoglou thought set the tone for Spurs, blazed past Trippier on the outside to cross for Udogie, who had a tap-in. Spurs could have had more in the first half. Sarr dragged wide when well placed from a Brennan Johnson cross while, before the end of it, Johnson kissed the outside of a post with a fierce shot and Richarlison could not stretch to reach a deflected Kulusevski cross after a Son burst. Newcastle flickered in the 34th minute after a loose Johnson pass, Guglielmo Vicario ending up denying Almirón, but Spurs’ second soon came when Son got the better of Trippier to pull back for Richarlison. Would Spurs waver in the second half? Given the recent body of evidence, it was impossible to discount the theory. But this was a day when everything clicked for them. Kulusevski, who wore a mask to protect a broken nose, was a menace, catching the eye when he lengthened his stride, while Johnson was very good, too. Newcastle had nothing in the tank. It was all over when Richarlison scored again. Pedro Porro’s diagonal was a thing of beauty and Richarlison stole away from Jamaal Lascelles to finish. The closing stages were open and chaotic, scarred by a horrible tackle by Romero on Wilson; the Spurs defender crunched in on his opponent and was fortunate to escape with a yellow card. Howe called it “dangerous” in a TV interview, “high and reckless” in his press conference. There was also a flare-up between Vicario and Wilson after the final whistle. Johnson hit the woodwork after a lovely Kulusevski pass, Oliver Skipp – on as a substitute – was denied one-on-one by Dubravka and Son might have had another after his penalty. Joelinton’s goal came from a Wilson pass after Spurs had lost possession in their defensive third."
Everton,2,Chelsea,0,Doucouré and Dobbin strike to give Everton victory against Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/10/everton-chelsea-premier-league-maytch-report,2023-12-10,"Chelsea spent more than £430m on new recruits this summer, the biggest outlay in a transfer window in Premier League history, yet Mauricio Pochettino’s response to a seventh league defeat of the season was to suggest they must spend again in January. What they need is character, resilience and fight. What they need are the qualities Sean Dyche has ingrained in Everton. It is 23 days since Everton were docked 10 points for a breach of Premier League profit and sustainability rules. They have clawed back nine points already with a hat-trick of league wins – the club’s first since the days of Carlo Ancelotti in March 2021 – with Chelsea the latest to succumb to Dyche’s defiant team. The expensively assembled visitors dominated possession at Goodison Park but were again found wanting not merely in front of goal but in terms of character. Everton showed it in abundance with an outstanding defensive display, the latest goal from Abdoulaye Doucouré and the substitute Lewis Dobbin’s first for the club delivering a merited victory. Dyche’s team would be 10th, four points above Chelsea, but for the deduction that is now under appeal. In the meantime, as their manager would say, they simply crack on. “I felt the first marker this season was we had to improve,” Dyche said. “Can we improve individuals, the team and the output in terms of results? We have done all of that and then some people took some of that away and said: ‘You have to start again.’ So we did. If you get a group of players who give everything to win, it’s a powerful thing.” Chelsea started and finished on top as they sought to recover from defeat at Manchester United on Wednesday – Everton, with fewer resources, had played 24 hours later when beating Newcastle – but rarely threatened to turn possession into penetration. Raheem Sterling and Nicolas Jackson were dropped to the bench after the midweek loss. Reece James returned to make his first start since being sent off against Newcastle last month but it was short-lived. The Chelsea captain, who has struggled with hamstring and knee problems this year, departed with another hamstring injury early on. The England defender has not completed 90 minutes since April, a fact that will not be lost on the watching Gareth Southgate. Injuries and fatigue contributed to a scrappy first half. Ashley Young exited with a hamstring problem having been tasked with a second successive start in four days, at the age of 38. It was a big ask that backfired, with the veteran struggling against Mykhailo Mudryk before his departure. Mudryk and Marc Cucurella carried Chelsea’s biggest threat down the left but there was no end product from the visitors. Jackson’s replacement, Armando Broja, flicked over from a Mudryk cross and Cole Palmer brought a fine save out of Jordan Pickford with a 25-yard drive. The Everton goalkeeper was relatively untroubled otherwise. Jarrad Branthwaite’s battle with Broja and another excellent display from Vitalii Mykolenko were major factors in a commanding defensive display. The England manager will also have noted the blossoming of Branthwaite alongside James Tarkowski in the heart of Dyche’s defence. Everton threatened little before the interval but attacked with greater aggression and purpose in the second half. Dwight McNeil was central to the improvement. The in-form winger forced the first serious save from Robert Sánchez when drilling Jack Harrison’s pass towards the bottom corner. He created the opener with a surging run through the Chelsea half that ended with a piercing pass into Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s run behind Benoît Badiashile. Sánchez was quick off his line to smother the striker’s shot but the rebound fell to Doucouré. The midfielder drove an emphatic finish past the stranded keeper for his sixth league goal of the season. It was Doucouré’s 11th goal since Dyche became Everton manager. He had scored five in just over two years before the appointment and had been ostracised from the first‑team setup by Frank Lampard. It took a tireless rearguard action for Everton to preserve their advantage. Palmer, booked in the first half for diving, stung Pickford’s palms with a low free-kick. Pochettino introduced Sterling and Jackson to intensify the pressure. The two almost combined to produce an equaliser late on but Jackson scuffed his close-range shot and the outstanding Tarkowski cleared. The Everton captain was instrumental in repelling Chelsea’s efforts and helping his goalkeeper to preserve a third successive clean sheet. Victory was secured in stoppage time. Djordje Petrovic, brought on to replace the injured Sánchez, punched James Garner’s corner to the edge of the Chelsea area under pressure from McNeil. His clearance dropped to the 20-year-old striker Dobbin, who opened his senior account with the sweetest of connections through a crowded box. “We were the better side but if you don’t score goals it’s difficult to win,” said Pochettino, stating the obvious. “We need to be more ruthless and after five months we need to check [on where improvement is needed]. That is something to analyse with the sporting director, to see what we can do to change the dynamic.”"
Fulham,5,West Ham,0,Raúl Jiménez kicks off five-star Fulham’s goal rush against West Ham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/10/fulham-west-ham-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-10,"Something magical must have happened in this part of south-west London during last month’s international break. At that point – in what must feel like a different era for Fulham fans – Marco Silva’s side had scored just 10 goals in their opening 12 Premier League fixtures and were trying their hardest not to look worriedly down. Four games later they have turned the division’s goalscoring dud into a lethal marksman, bloodied the noses of some teams with lofty aspirations, and found the net a scarcely conceivable 16 times. After what Silva had described as one of the toughest pre-seasons of his career, Fulham have belatedly sprung to life in spectacular fashion. If the 5-0 on Wednesday carried the caveat that it came against lowly Nottingham Forest, this same remarkable scoreline four days later warranted no asterisk. It was, Silva said, “a much more complete performance” than that previous mauling. So much so that the staircases in the away end swelled after only an hour, filled with West Ham supporters making an early escape back across London, the joy from their 2-1 victory against Tottenham three days earlier painfully short-lived. David Moyes – completing his post‑game media duties with the kind of ruthless haste lacking from his players – suggested his team’s exertions in that win had taken their toll. “We used up too much energy in midweek,” he said. “We weren’t able to get ourselves back. Another Thursday fixture, Fulham had a Wednesday fixture. No excuse for the result but it played a part in it. It is disappointing, but we’ve had two difficult away games this week – three points from the two games is not a bad return.” Although accustomed to ceding possession under Moyes, an all-too-brief bright West Ham start had faded rapidly to gloom as they were quickly outplayed in all areas. Fulham’s opener continued the unlikely resurgence of Raúl Jiménez, who has now consigned to history a run of 33 goalless Premier League games by scoring four in his past five matches. This one came courtesy of a powerful header to finish a lethal João Palhinha whipped cross. The hosts had two more before half‑time. Palhinha was again the provider for Fulham’s second, fizzing the ball across the six-yard box where Willian calmly curled it into the bottom corner. Tosin Adarabioyo then added a thunderous headed third from Andreas Pereira’s corner. Fifteen minutes into the second half, the substitute Harry Wilson extinguished any West Ham comeback hopes when he curled the ball expertly into the top corner from range with a lethal mixture of precision and power that he will find hard to replicate. With daylight fading, the visitors saved their worst until last. Undone by nothing more than a straight long ball, the West Ham defence were entirely absent as Wilson bore down on Fabianski’s goal and knocked the ball to his fellow substitute Carlos Vinícius in support, who tapped into an empty net. “A brilliant performance from us,” was Silva’s verdict. “A great win at a very good level. No doubt we were the best team on the pitch, not just because we won 5-0 but the way we performed. The way we were solid as a team, to express ourselves, to create chances to score goals, the way we did it was an almost perfect afternoon for us. “We didn’t give almost nothing for them. We controlled it well. It’s not easy to control a team like West Ham, with the quality they have.” Asked what had prompted Fulham’s remarkable recent turnaround, he said: “Confidence builds confidence, the best example is Raúl. But we are not doing anything really different. The trust in our players was always there. The process is not something new or from the last four games – it’s from the day I joined this football club. We are always trying to improve things and we did it really well the last two games. We are growing as a team.” The win puts Fulham in the top half of the table for the first time this season, just one spot behind West Ham. The visitors had reaped all the benefits of Moyes’s cautious approach in the win at Spurs, defending stoutly and capitalising on their rare chances. But despite a run of six games without defeat before this, results have not been enough to prevent criticism of the drab style. This defeat will only add to the growing voices of dissent. When Saïd Benrahma almost cleared the Putney End stand late on with a wild blaze from range the visitors’ humiliation was complete on a day to forget."
Luton,1,City,2,Manchester City’s quickfire double seals comeback win at Luton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/10/luton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-10,"Just above the goal at the Domino’s Oak Stand at Luton, above the advert for Noble Solicitors and below the scoreboard, is a blue sign on which is written in white: “History is Made in Luton.” Which, frankly, at kick-off seemed an improbable, almost inexplicable, claim. As it did by the final whistle. But for about half an hour between Elijah Adebayo giving Luton the lead and Bernardo Silva equalising, it did seem Kenilworth Road might be witnessing something very significant indeed. As it was, Manchester City, while being nowhere near their best, battled back to win and are just four points off the top. Whatever this is they are going through – blip, correction, all-out collapse – has at least been temporarily arrested and, with a relatively kind fixture list to come either side of the Club World Cup, they remain title favourites with their spring surge still to come. Still, though, this was a hard-won victory. It may in time come to be seen as another less-than-impressive display in a mid-season slump, but it could just as easily be the battle that once again stiffened sinews and shook off any lingering issues of hunger and desire after the completion of the quest for the treble. Pep Guardiola had spoken of his side, and himself, perhaps benefiting from the blow to the face of the defeat at Aston Villa. There was another slap here. Luton, for their part, should take both pride and encouragement from another gutsy performance against one of the elite, but remain in the relegation zone. It was 25 years since City had last played at Kenilworth Road, when both sides were in the third tier and a back-post header from the current coach of Sri Lanka, Andy Morrison, was cancelled out by a Gary Doherty bullet. Even then the old ground felt like a throwback and on Sunday even the weather had a heritage feel: a stiff breeze ensured that the gobbets of thick rain had yielded by kick-off to a sky of chilly blue, but intermittent showers persisted through the afternoon. The stage could not have been better set for the treble winners to slip up, particularly given Luton had held Liverpool to a draw and last week lost against Arsenal only in the final seconds of added time. On this pitch – it is regulation size but the bulk of so many home players gives the illusion of pokiness – before these fans, Luton have been very good at thwarting more gifted and glamorous opponents. “Conference champions, you’ll never sing that,” the Luton fans chanted – although given the 115 charges against them, City are arguably closer to winning the National League than any other current Premier League side. Erling Haaland was missing, hobbling around in a plastic boot with what Guardiola called a “bone stress reaction”, so Julián Álvarez started up front. Losing a striker who, even if not quite at his very best this season, has contributed 14 goals in 15 league games can never be a good thing, but allowing Álvarez to return to the forward line in effect gave City an extra midfielder, which in turn meant there was no need for either centre-back to operate as an auxiliary holding midfielder in the John Stones manner. Without City being anywhere near their fluent best, the first half had felt like an exercise in waiting for them to score. Thomas Kaminski has probably been Luton’s best player so far this season and the Belgian keeper excelled again, making a couple of saves from Phil Foden and a more spectacular but probably less technically good one-handed save from Rodri. Álvarez poked a near-post effort tamely wide from a Jack Grealish cross. It was all a bit bitty, a bit winter afternoon in Luton – which of course it was, but it’s been the great strength of Guardiola over the years that his sides can make any setting feel like a balmy evening at the Camp Nou. There were a surprising number of long-range shots, at least one of them from Kyle Walker, which is never a good sign. It was not a good day for those who would have players calculate the xG before essaying any attempt on goal. Then, on the stroke of half-time, the unthinkable. Luton’s threat had been limited, but then Andros Townsend suddenly found a little space on the right. His ball to the back post was perfect and Adebayo rose above Rúben Dias to nod the ball in from close range. Could this be it, an unexpected defeat, the first time Guardiola had ever gone five league games without a win, a first loss for Rodri since Scotland beat Spain in March? The answer came swiftly: no, on all counts. Kaminski had already made a remarkable reflex save to tip a Rodri snap-shot against the bar when Bernardo Silva bent in the equaliser just after the hour and within three minutes Grealish had scuffed a finish between Kaminski’s legs as Teden Mengi seemingly suffered a bout of cramp as he tried to deal with Álvarez’s cross. And so history was not made in Luton, not today, but what did come into being, perhaps, was a renewed sense of resilience for the champions."
Brighton,1,Burnley,1,Burnley and Trafford withstand Brighton onslaught to earn point,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/09/brighton-burnley-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-09,"Vincent Kompany said Burnley will need more outstanding individual performances in order to survive in the Premier League after James Trafford put in a superb display in his team’s 1-1 draw against Brighton at the Amex Stadium. The visitors took the lead against the run of play courtesy of a brilliant strike from Wilson Odobert, taking advantage as three Brighton players stood off him and unleashing a wicked drive that nicked off James Milner and flew over Bart Verbruggen into the top corner. At that stage, Trafford had already saved well from Milner and Pascal Gross and he continued to repel the home side’s attempts to claw the game back, racing from his goal to keep out Simon Adingra with a sprawling block in the second half. Burnley were finally breached when Adingra nodded in a cross from the excellent Gross minutes later, but Trafford would save his best until last, first showing outstanding reflexes to beat away a header from the substitute Jack Hinshelwood in stoppage time before flinging himself towards the top corner to somehow fingertip Karou Mitoma’s volley over the bar. “The game demanded it at the end,” said Kompany. “You don’t come to these places and get a result without moments like this. “It’s in the bank for him [Trafford], in terms of having come through this. He needs to keep working on becoming the best he can be. We’re very fortunate to have two very good goalkeepers. “His season has been no different to everyone else in the team. He’s improved throughout the season, shown good signs. He’s been more and more consistent and ultimately at this level consistency is the key word. “We have more and more players who perform at a consistent level. In games like today, without someone having an outstanding performance, you never get results.” Burnley were seeking only their second away win of the season but despite defending bravely after taking the lead they were left to rue more dropped points on the road, though the gap to Everton in 17th place has been cut to two points. “We’re not at a level yet where we can compete every week with teams like Brighton on an equal level,” said Kompany. “There’s a tremendous belief in me that the club is going in the right direction. Our biggest, unique strength is it’s an elite club in terms of the attitude, the standard and the habits. I would put us against anybody. The amount of belief and resilience we’ve got. It’s a special club that really lives. “It’s not for no reason that after such a tough start, you still see progression, you still see people getting better. That won’t stop.” Roberto De Zerbi reflected that there is still a way to go before his side can consider themselves in the league’s top bracket. “I consider my team a very good team, I have big, big confidence,” the Brighton manager said. “There isn’t anyone more than me who believes in my players. But we are not a top team yet, because a top team wins today, against Sheffield [United] and against Fulham.” Both those games at the Amex also finished 1-1. “Winning these three games, we would be third in the table. These three games, we played very well and we deserved to win. Why didn’t we win these three games? Maybe because we are not a top team yet. Maybe the coach of Brighton is not a top, top coach yet.”"
Palace,1,Liverpool,2,Elliott’s late winner sends Liverpool top with comeback at 10-man Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/09/crystal-palace-liverpool-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-09,"A scrappy, tetchy game of football; two disputed penalty decisions; a deflected equaliser; whole minutes of aimless waiting around while a man in shorts watched a little screen. And then, finally, a moment of grace that this game categorically did not deserve and Liverpool barely did. It came from Harvey Elliott, gliding through the Crystal Palace defence like a man dancing on lily pads, scoring the injury-time goal that earned Liverpool another grubby and scowling three points. Improbably, almost imperceptibly, they are now top of the Premier League, after Arsenal’s defeat at Aston Villa. And in the end, the only thing that ended up “spoiled” was Roy Hodgson’s day. After being forced to apologise for his comments in midweek that Palace fans needed to be more grateful, this was a fixture that suited his browbeaten underdog persona perfectly. Palace did almost everything right here: frustrated, defended tightly, scored on the break. Until a soft second yellow card issued to Jordan Ayew with 15 minutes remaining, they were good value for a famous victory. But Ayew’s dismissal turned the game, invited even more Liverpool pressure, opened up just a little more space for them to operate. Mohamed Salah equalised soon afterwards, Jürgen Klopp’s substitutions were ruthless and proactive, Elliott beautifully seized the points late on, and yet they were still reliant on the heroics of their goalkeeper Alisson in the 100th minute to seal their victory. Liverpool’s two goals came from their only two shots on target. And, of course, there is still a good deal of room for improvement from a team who fancy themselves potential champions. For some reason – probably some cocktail of fatigue and travel and disgruntlement and breakfast fusilli – the vibes were all off here. The level of physical commitment was still fine, but the lack of creative spark was startling. Indeed, my notes from an utterly uneventful first half-hour consist of just three entries. Quansah – bit nervous. Ayew: clever player! Great appreciation of angles and weight distribution. Football’s Alan McManus? If Darwin’s theory really holds then why hasn’t he evolved a way to stay onside? So, yeah: not great content, by any standard. And the 20-year-old Jarell Quansah did look a bit jittery at centre-half, but he was by no means alone. There was a penalty for Palace, and then there wasn’t: Virgil van Dijk clumsily clattered into Odsonne Édouard from behind, only for VAR to overturn the decision for an earlier foul by Will Hughes. On the touchline, Hodgson unloaded a great big gob of spit on to his technical area. It was that kind of game. Still Klopp kept trying to change things, kept moving his pieces around the board. Salah went up top for a bit and Darwin Núñez tacked out wide. Trent Alexander-Arnold went into the centre at half-time, replacing the soggy Wataru Endo. Quansah and Ryan Gravenberch were gone before the hour, although not before Quansah had given away the penalty from which Jean-Philippe Mateta put Palace ahead: a desperate tap on the ankle as both tried to meet a cross from Hughes. But ultimately Liverpool just had more tools in their bag. Cody Gakpo and Joe Gomez formed an effective partnership on the right; Elliott and Curtis Jones offered fresh legs in midfield. Salah tucked in his 200th Liverpool goal, a scrappy shot from close range after Michael Olise had failed to deal with a Gakpo cross, and as the minutes ticked away it felt like a point would be the limit of their ambitions. But then came Elliott, receiving the ball from Salah and finding the moment of poise and clarity amid the melee. You had to feel a little for Palace, who amid a poor run of form, rotten luck with injuries and an increasing disconnect between the club and its supporters, showed plenty of resolve and fight. Their physicality earned them seven yellow cards, plus one for Hodgson himself, but they probably should have gone ahead early through Jefferson Lerma and could even have nicked a late equaliser through Joachim Andersen. Instead, they have gone even further backwards: no points, a suspension for Ayew and worrying injuries to Lerma, Édouard and Sam Johnstone. Somehow, meanwhile, Liverpool have nine points from their last three games. It has been one hell of a slog, one that will have felt more like a gruelling military campaign than a sporting adventure. Still they roll on. A Europa League dead rubber on Thursday is followed by Manchester United at Anfield next Sunday: a potential inflection point in a season that, for all its fits and starts, may just be about to take flight."
Villa,1,Arsenal,0,John McGinn sinks Arsenal to deliver another statement win for Aston Villa,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/09/aston-villa-arsenal-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-09,"How do you top reducing the kings to pawns? It was a question on the lips of the Aston Villa supporters basking in these rather heady days and a conundrum for Unai Emery, their manager who is growing more untouchable by the week, to solve. The simple answer is a club-record 15th straight home league victory, one which came against the erstwhile leaders, Arsenal, nonetheless. John McGinn’s early strike was sufficient to move Villa – who survived a late VAR check when Arsenal had a goal ruled out for handball against Kai Havertz – to within two points of the summit and one behind Arsenal. Perhaps Villa really are bona fide title contenders, as Pep Guardiola suggested in midweek. For the second time in four days, Villa Park played host to a mouthwatering contest. After Villa’s evisceration of the champions, Manchester City, on Wednesday, it was impossible not to wonder whether they would have the might – mentally as well as physically – to perform again at full tilt. They inevitably faded but the answer was resounding and one that became obvious within seven minutes, at which point Villa seized the lead through their captain. McGinn put the cherry on the cake of a slick team move. In five passes, Villa went from halfway to rippling the back of David Raya’s net. Leon Bailey destroyed Gabriel Magalhães and Oleksandr Zinchenko, the only change made across both starting lineups, and then had the poise to locate McGinn lurking on the edge of the six-yard box. McGinn controlled the ball on his right foot with his back to goal and promptly swivelled clear of Ben White and buried the ball past Raya with his left, his next touch. As the Villa faithful serenaded “Super John McGinn”, Mikel Arteta looked on stony-faced from the directors’ box. Arteta, serving a touchline ban, sat along from Edu, the sporting director, next to Miguel Molina, his tactical assistant coach, and in front of Vinai Venkatesham, Arsenal’s chief executive officer who is departing at the end of the season. Arteta’s annoyance would be understandable at the best of times but perhaps a few numbers entered his thinking; Villa have now not lost any of the past 21 games in which they opened the scoring, winning the past 10 in a row. Arteta may have been absent but Emery, whom Arteta replaced after his fellow Basque’s unhappy and sapping 18-month spell, was choreographing another compelling, voracious Villa display. Villa had to show different faces here and dug deep to fend off swells of Arsenal pressure. The outlook was ominous, then, for Arsenal but, unlike City in midweek, they put Emiliano Martínez’s goal under sustained pressure. Martínez, the former Arsenal goalkeeper who in October won the Yashin Trophy at the Ballon d’Or awards, saved smartly from Gabriel Jesus and Martin Ødegaard before the break. Ødegaard should have done better, too. Havertz made inroads down the left and he expertly the cut ball back for Jesus, whose effortless first touch on the penalty spot perfectly laid the ball on a plate for Ødegaard. But the Arsenal captain, who earlier skittled a shot against the side netting, could not get enough conviction on his strike and his shot was also too close to the Villa goalkeeper. Arsenal arrived on to the pitch a couple of minutes early for the second half, for which Moussa Diaby entered for Villa, replacing the injured Bailey. Arsenal had won six games on the bounce and had no desire to go under here. Their response was impressive and they fashioned several chances. For Villa, this was a breathless encounter of another kind. They had to activate survival mode on a few occasions. Ødegaard side-footed a first-time effort wide after Havertz drove into space in the left channel and Bukayo Saka, given his Arsenal debut by Emery five years ago, had a goal disallowed for offside. Villa almost gifted Arsenal an equaliser when Martínez’s pawed clearance from a Saka corner bounced off Ollie Watkins and against a post. Early in the second half Lucas Digne resorted to clinging on to the coattail of Saka’s yellow shirt, earning himself a routine yellow card. An invariable touch of controversy came in the 90th minute. Arteta could only agonise in the stand as the VAR Michael Salisbury reviewed the referee Jarred Gillett’s decision to disallow the substitute Eddie Nketiah’s strike, after Havertz was penalised for handball under pressure from Matty Cash. Arsenal, to their credit, did not relent but Villa held on to record another magnificent victory. The last time Villa lost here in the league was against Arsenal in mid-February. A 4-2 defeat, in which they conceded two stoppage-time goals, left Villa in mid-table, relegation still a distinct, albeit unlikely, prospect. This season they are mixing it in a different stratosphere, the possibilities very much endless."
Sheffield,1,Brentford,0,Joy for Wilder as McAtee sinks Brentford to earn Sheffield United precious victory,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/09/sheffield-united-brentford-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-09,"Whisper it quietly but the rewilding of Sheffield United may just have started. “Chrissy Wilder, he’s one of our own,” rang out from the Kop as the Premier League’s bottom team followed up Wednesday’s competitive performance against Liverpool with the first victory of their returning hero’s latest reign. In a game low on quality but high on resilience, two fatigued teams were divided by James McAtee’s sumptuous first goal in the Premier League, in first-half stoppage time, and the added belief that the lead and the manager’s return yielded. In the era of three points for a win, the only team with eight points or fewer from their first 15 games to survive relegation from the top flight were – insert drum roll – Sheffield United in 1990-91, with one Chris Wilder in their playing ranks. Now they are up and running with Wilder, who led them from the bottom of League One to the top half of the Premier League in his first spell, back in the dugout. Not that he spent too much time there on Saturday as he headed every ball and screamed for the final whistle as this match ran beyond its four allocated minutes of added time. Then, Brentford were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when the ball struck Anel Ahmedhodzic on the arm. When VAR deemed it was no offence, the referee, Stuart Attwell, blew for full-time. The lyrics “You fill up my senses” can barely have rung truer for this son of Sheffield and his 28,000 acolytes. “It’s really emotional,” Wilder said. “The first win is huge for everyone.” Going into Everton’s game with Chelsea on Sunday, that leaves Sheffield United two points shy of 17th place. They travel to Chelsea and Aston Villa next, so no one is throwing garlands down for a procession to salvation just yet. But it no longer seems impossible. “Listen, small steps,” Wilder said. “I’m not looking beyond next week. We have to go into every match with a gameplan.” Brentford’s fourth defeat in five games is prompting no sense of crisis. Deprived of their main sources of goals with Bryan Mbeumo out with an injured ankle and Ivan Toney still a month away from the end of his ban, they unsurprisingly lacked belief, as well as nine players. Thomas Frank said: “It’s clear we’ve lost our most offensive player of the season. Take the top producer out of any team, they’ll feel it. It’s up to me to find a solution; it’s up to the others to take steps forward but sometimes it doesn’t happen first time.” For all Brentford’s absentees, they were the more dominant team in the first half, although they were highly fortunate not to lose another player when Frank Onyeka could have been sent off. The midfielder was cautioned for his foul on Vinícius Souza; replays showed his challenge was late and high. Moments after, Archer had chugged clear from the halfway line, only for Andre Brooks to stumble on receiving his pass inside the area. But Brentford only cleared as far as Gustavo Hamer, whose pass went wide right to McAtee. Turning inside, from the corner of the area, the Manchester City loanee, who was a frequent scorer in his first season here last year, lofted a brilliant shot into the far top corner. It was arguably more than the home side deserved but with both teams low on confidence it was the timely shot in the arm. They came back out for the second half with renewed vigour, the crowd finally cranking up the volume. Soon, they could have been two goals ahead. Archer played a low cross through for Anis Slimane only for the substitute’s instinctive effort to be expertly saved by Mark Flekken. The Brentford goalkeeper also parried Archer’s shot when the former Aston Villa striker again managed to wriggle clear. Slimane should have sealed the points moments later when, winning possession from a Brentford throw deep in their own half, he arrowed in on goal but, with the luxury of a three v one, opted to shoot and found the side-netting."
United,0,Bournemouth,3,Manchester United stunned 3-0 as Bournemouth break Old Trafford duck,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/09/manchester-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-09,"This was jubilation for Bournemouth and a crimson embarrassment for Manchester United which would have been worse had Dango Ouattara’s late strike not been ruled out, via VAR, because of the player’s handball. But make no mistake, Erik ten Hag’s team were a rabble reminiscent of the United of the dog days under his predecessor, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, and so at the final whistle the boos that greeted them were no surprise. Bournemouth’s second goal, in the 68th minute, killed off Ten Hag’s side en route to a first ever victory at Old Trafford. A loose Luke Shaw pass was intercepted by the Cherries, who motored upfield. Dominic Solanke fed Marcus Tavernier on the left and, when he lifted the ball in, up rose substitute Philip Billing to crash in a memorable header. Worse, if possible, was to follow as Ten Hag’s ragtag bunch conceded another aerial goal. This time Marcos Senesi’s header beat André Onana, to the United goalkeeper’s left. Some home supporters left immediately and the travelling congregation sang “Hey Iraola” about their adored manager, Andoni Iraola. All of this followed Solanke’s fifth-minute finish – he might have had another towards the end but fluffed the attempt – and meant by the final whistle Bournemouth had taken their total tally here from five to eight in a seventh league visit. The result leaves United with a goal difference of minus three from nine wins and seven defeats and reinforces the sense of this Ten Hag side as an enigma. The manager himself might privately admit that he has little clue which one will turn up on any match day. Might it be the slick unit that administered a 2-1 defeat of Chelsea here on Wednesday? Or the insipid sleepwalkers of this afternoon that never convinced from the moment Solanke turned in Lewis Cook’s cross from the right? Two moments, seconds into the second half, offered an apt picture of how United performed versus this resurgent Bournemouth. First, Solanke turned Shaw inside and out and went close to making it 2-0. Then, as United countered from this move, Anthony Martial sent Alejandro Garnacho zipping along the left and though sustained pressure and a Bruno Fernandes shot followed, this was blocked as a killer blow before goal was lacking. A little after this Ten Hag took off the ineffective Martial and introduced Rasmus Højlund. Yet nothing much changed. United struggled to create for their new No 9 to finally break his Premier League duck. A quick one-two with Fernandes engineered an opening but the Dane’s effort was mis-hit. Then came a quicksilver moment, perhaps United’s best: Diogo Dalot darted through from right-back and swapped passes with Antony but the shot hit the side-netting. After the bright performance and victory over Chelsea what United did not need was to be rocked five minutes in. Here, Scott McTominay turned from the two-goal hero of that win to chief culprit as, slumbering, he allowed Cook to mug him along the right. The midfielder trotted forward, rolled the ball in and the unmarked Solanke slid past Onana for a too simple opener. It was hapless from Ten Hag’s men, for whom a step forward is too often followed by a retrograde one. In the pre-game briefings the manager cited the need to be consistent so this, as he stated afterwards, “annoyed”. After a further scare for the home team – Tavernier’s headed goal was disallowed for Solanke’s offside at the latter’s initial header – they launched a sweeping move. Sergio Reguilón, in for Victor Lindelöf, burst through, curved the ball left to Garnacho, the winger roved in, but Iraola’s men escaped. While Marcus Rashford again being left out was no surprise, Højlund not starting a second league game out of the past three was, Martial once more his replacement. The Frenchman has one Premier League goal this season and though this is more than the 20-year-old, Ten Hag’s decision was a puzzle. As is where, precisely, his team are heading. Yet while this bloody nose leaves United with 12 points from the last 18, for Bournemouth all is rosy as they have taken 13 points from the last 15. Next up for United is a trip to Liverpool, for which Fernandes is suspended after being booked."
Wolves,1,Forest,1,Cunha earns point for Wolves against Nottingham Forest after Toffolo opener,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/09/wolves-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-09,"There was a long wave to the away end at Molineux and it was greeted with raucous chants of “There’s only one Stevie Cooper” but whether those fans will get another chance to celebrate their manager in person is unknown. Cooper changed the personnel, style and fortunes of Nottingham Forest to secure a draw at Wolves after four straight defeats, although it might not be enough to earn another stay of execution. Cooper, who was under scrutiny coming into the match, made seven changes from the team that lost 5-0 to Fulham in midweek and implemented a different formation, selecting a 3-5-2 after using 4-2-3-1 at Craven Cottage, although did not include a recognised striker. When a manager is unsure of his best XI, it is always a concern and instability on the pitch is rarely a recipe for success, especially when the cook is guessing the ingredients, but it provided a fighting response from those selected. “That’s the last thing it was,” Cooper said when asked if he was waving goodbye to the fans. “I was saying ‘Thank you for your support, you’ve spent a lot of money this week, you’ve dragged the players through challenging times in the game and safe journey home’. I am just full of gratitude.” Forest’s opener came from an unlikely source when Toti’s pass out of defence was intercepted by Cheikhou Kouyaté, before passing it out to Neco Williams on the right wing where he had time to pick out Harry Toffolo, who headed home at the back post for his first goal for the club he joined in 2022. A tier of red sang for Cooper throughout, although that was intermittently drowned out by the home supporters chanting “You’re getting sacked in the morning”, as they witnessed a side thrown together in 48 hours look composed and organised. Prior to kick-off Wolves fans instigated a protest against VAR after being on the wrong end of a number of contentious decisions from the officials in Stockley Park. Supporters held up posters calling for an end to the use of technology in the game. Thankfully for all concerned Chris Kavanagh, in his west London cupboard, was not called up to help determine the result. Wolves, who have not lost at home in three months, were insipid in the early stages but they began to dominate possession after Forest opened the scoring. The equaliser arrived thanks to smart interplay between Mario Lemina and Pablo Sarabia, who pulled the ball back to Matheus Cunha in space to slot into the bottom corner. Cooper was left unhappy with the “basic error” in awarding a throw-in during the buildup. The Wolves manager, Gary O’Neil, said: “I would say it is a throw-in, there are a lot of things that go on after the throw-in for us to score a goal. Steve should maybe have a look at some of the decisions that go against us because when it is a penalty it is a lot harder to stop than a throw.” Forest were gifted a chance to retake the lead when Max Kilman took too long on the ball while facing his own goal, allowing Kouyaté to dispossess him but the returning José Sá blocked his shot. The second half was an even contest and Forest should have taken the lead through their marauding wing-back Toffolo, who once again got on the end of a Williams cross but somehow headed over the bar from four yards. He once scored five in seven matches for Huddersfield, so maybe those in attendance should not have been surprised by his attacking prowess. Defensive mistakes seemed the most likely manner in which chances would be created. Murillo was the latest to commit an almost costly error when he passed the ball to Cunha, who surged in the box, only to see Matt Turner repel his jab. It was the last opportunity of note as neither side could muster the quality to find a winner, which Cooper desperately needed after one victory in 12. “I am really proud of the team, away from home, team spirit, togetherness,” Cooper said. “If you look at the game in isolation, you would be satisfied with a point away from home. We are disappointed we have not won but then if you add to all the sideshows that might be going on, and especially after Fulham where we let ourselves down in every way, shape and form.”"
Spurs,1,West Ham,2,Ward-Prowse caps West Ham comeback as Tottenham squander another lead,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/07/tottenham-west-ham-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-07,"The other four felt different: Chelsea had a numerical advantage, Wolves seemed little more than a late aberration, Aston Villa was an unfortunate freak, Manchester City a hard-fought point. But on this occasion – a Premier League record fifth successive match that Tottenham have thrown away a lead – the excuses are starting to run thin. They were simply not good enough for too much of the match, namely the whole second half. At the half-time break there had been a sense of when, or how many, the home side would score, so dominant were they in dictating proceedings when in possession (which was almost the entirety). But they barely came close after Cristian Romero’s early opener. There was admittedly a sense of the unaccountable about both West Ham goals: Jarrod Bowen benefiting from a wicked double deflection and James Ward-Prowse gifted an empty net to tap into. But there comes a point where Tottenham’s attractive football – of which there was plenty, as always under Ange Postecoglou – must pay dividends. Home supporters have now endured three consecutive home league defeats for the first time since 2008 and that 10-game unbeaten run to kick off the season is a distant memory. “It is unacceptable,” said the Spurs captain, Son Heung-min. “As players we should take responsibility. They are tough to play against but we knew what was coming. 1-0 is not enough, you have to try and win the game. “The fans do not deserve this. When you go 1-0 up early you should bring more energy and play with more energy but we didn’t and that is why we lost. When you have the chances to kill the game you have to play better.” Romero’s fine looping header, muscling his way between defenders to attack Pedro Porro’s corner, looked like being the first of many Spurs goals in a first half of total dominance. The hosts’ slick interplay and rapid progression up the pitch rendered West Ham’s attacking players obsolete for large swathes. It was all the visitors could do to boot the ball into opposition territory for a momentary breather before weathering the inevitable next wave. That West Ham were level within seven minutes of the restart owed much to a huge dose of good fortune. A speculative Mohammed Kudus crack from range ricocheted first off Romero and then Ben Davies straight into the path of the unwitting Bowen, who could not believe his luck with the goal at his mercy. He duly smashed it past Guglielmo Vicario. Then it happened; the type of moment that encourages opposition supporters to use that yawningly dull phrase “Spursy”. Under minimal pressure, Destiny Udogie self-imploded by playing a woefully underhit back pass to Vicario, whose only option was to hare out and push the ball clear with Bowen bearing down on him. Presented with the opportunity to shoot as the goalkeeper lay on the floor, Ward-Prowse’s initial effort hit the post, only to rebound straight back for him to pass into an empty net. Despite increasingly desperate pleas from the home supporters, Tottenham rarely came close to equalising. A poor Richarlison header when unmarked six yards out epitomised their plight. “It’s another game where we’ve dominated and we haven’t turned that dominance into something more tangible,” said Postecoglou. “We kept the opposition in the game. I thought we were very poor in both boxes today. Those two goals were terrible goals for us to concede. “This is not about playing good football, this is about winning games of football. I try to set up teams to win. 1-0 up at half-time was not a good performance from us. A good performance would be three or four goals up at half-time.” Asked what he thinks is to blame for Tottenham’s continued failure to hold on to leads, the Australian said: “It’s just not having that conviction in front of goal to finish things off. As simple as that. “If we were out on our feet then you could factor that into it. But I don’t see that. At the moment we’re just going through this spell where we’re so-called playing good football but I don’t see that. “What I see is us not really showing any clear conviction in what we’re doing. We’ve a long way to go as a team and today is further evidence of that.” Despite guiding West Ham to the top half of the Premier League and the Europa League knockout stages, David Moyes has increasingly faced criticism for a series of uninspiring performances from his side. This was a victory to show the benefit of his pragmatism. “We were up against it tonight,” he said. “We had to dig in. Thankfully we just about scraped it. The quality Tottenham showed in the first half, I don’t know if we touched the ball for eight or nine minutes. “We gained a bit of confidence once we got some passes. We wanted to get after them a bit more but by the same breath we were cautious about them picking us off. We are a team who can give some of the good teams a bloody nose. We have that in us.”"
Everton,3,Newcastle,0,McNeil and Doucouré feast on Trippier errors as Everton outlast Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/07/everton-newcastle-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-07,"The old refrain of “We shall not be moved” has sounded even more defiant since Everton were plunged into the relegation zone by the biggest sporting sanction in Premier League history. It was a fitting soundtrack to Everton clambering out of it at Goodison Park courtesy of a resounding defeat of shell-shocked Newcastle. Eddie Howe’s side suffered their heaviest defeat of the season on a calamitous night for Kieran Trippier but a reaffirming one for Sean Dyche. Everton were at risk of being punished for another wasteful home display, with Newcastle finally growing into the contest, when the England international presented Dwight McNeil with a decisive breakthrough taken in style. Trippier’s head was buried in his shirt seven minutes later when a similar error resulted in Abdoulaye Doucouré scoring Everton’s second. Having insisted his team just needed to add goals to otherwise strong home performances, Dyche got the comfort of a third when Beto registered his first Premier League goal in stoppage time. No prizes for guessing the unfortunate Newcastle defender who kept Everton’s summer signing just onside. “Kieran has been absolutely magnificent since he signed for the football club, a big catalyst for what has happened,” said the Newcastle manager. “Collectively we were off our best tonight.” Howe declined to use an extensive injury list as an excuse, although the visitors were lethargic in spells and had few answers to Everton’s punishing finale. Howe added: “Last year our away form was very good but we haven’t got going on the road this season, apart from Sheffield United. It’s a difficult one to understand.” Dyche denied before and after the game that being out of the bottom three would be psychologically important for Everton. The crowd and perhaps his players might disagree. There was a determination and desire to the home side throughout. Their relentless pressing of Newcastle continued until the final seconds with 38-year-old Ashley Young pursing his man into a corner. There was also a heated exchange between the outstanding James Tarkowski and Joelinton after the final whistle, with coaching staff and Jordan Pickford getting involved. “I’ve got no idea what it was over,” claimed Howe. “I think it was just emotions running high after the game. We were certainly disappointed with our performance.” The Park End was a sea of green at kick-off, and in the 10th minute, when Everton fans held aloft cards bearing the Premier League logo between the message “Protecting the few, not the many” as part of ongoing protests against the club’s 10-point deduction for a financial breach. The home crowd was otherwise focused on pushing Dyche’s team towards only a second home league win of the season, breaking only to boo Anthony Gordon whenever he touched the ball on his return to Goodison. Dyche was forced to change his team at lunchtime due to James Garner falling ill. The Everton manager responded by moving Doucouré into central midfield and pushing Young to right wing. At right-back in came the redoubtable Seamus Coleman for his first appearance since undergoing surgery on a serious knee injury suffered at Leicester in May. The return of the 35-year-old means he has played for Everton for a remarkable 15 seasons in succession. In financial terms, Coleman’s £60,000 transfer fee from Sligo Rovers now works out at £4,000 per season in Everton colours. Coleman and Young were at the forefront of a bright Everton start that was only undermined by carelessness with the final pass and their usual profligacy in front of goal at Goodison this season. Dominic Calvert-Lewin missed a glaring opportunity to reward Everton’s pressure shortly before the interval. Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite both beat Newcastle defenders to a Pickford free-kick. The latter’s touch fell to Calvert-Lewin, onside, unmarked and five yards in front of goal, but having controlled neatly on his chest he turned and blazed a volley over. Newcastle’s front three of Gordon, Alexander Isak and Miguel Almirón were frequently isolated and only threatened once the former Everton player switched wings with the Paraguay international. It took 36 minutes for the visitors to create a genuine chance from open play. Isak should have done better when Trippier’s first-time cross picked him out at the back post than to steer a header yards wide. Howe’s team improved after the break with Gordon missing two decent chances in quick succession. But then came the finale Trippier will wish to forget. With 11 minutes of normal time remaining the right-back collected a pass from Jamaal Lascelles and stumbled over the ball while attempting to turn. McNeil pounced in a flash. Seizing possession, the winger sprinted from deep inside the Newcastle half to the edge of the area where he unleashed an unstoppable finish high into Martin Dubravka’s left-hand corner. Everton’s wild celebrations were almost silenced immediately when Almirón charged down Branthwaite’s clearance and raced clear. Not for the first time, Newcastle were foiled by an immaculate interception from Tarkowski. It was to get worse for Trippier. The experienced defender committed another error, gifting possession to Jack Harrison not once but twice. The on-loan winger darted down the left and, though McNeil missed his low cross, Doucouré dispatched it convincingly. Goodison howled at the addition of 10 minutes but it afforded time for Beto to open his Premier League account. Sent clear down the right by Nathan Patterson, the summer signing held off the attentions of Fabian Schär to beat Newcastle’s stand-in keeper with another clinical finish. “We’ve got a very authentic group of players,” said Dyche. “That doesn’t mean we are brilliant but it means we have a connected group of players who really care and I think the Toffees respect that.”"
United,2,Chelsea,1,McTominay spares Fernandes’s blushes as Manchester United beat Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/06/manchester-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-06,"After defeat at Newcastle on Saturday and, to a lesser extent, the ban of four media organisations from the pre‑game press conference on Tuesday, Manchester United and Erik ten Hag required a win. In elite sport this is the only way to control the message, no matter the PR strategy, and the mission was accomplished thanks to Scott McTominay, who scored his second Premier League double of the season. Until his 69th-minute intervention United were heading for another case of a bright start being blighted by switching off, as his opener was cancelled out by a Cole Palmer finish. If so the inquest into Ten Hag and his team would have had a next chapter. But instead this skirmish of two fallen heavyweights ended with United moving into sixth on 27 points – only three behind Manchester City – and Chelsea, for all their investment, languishing in 10th. Ten Hag said: “We are going in the right direction and won’t get distracted by criticism. We are pleased with the result and the performance. We deserved this. We wanted to send this message to the crowd but this is also our style. In the first 30 minutes we did it perfectly on the pitch.” Of McTominay, the manager said: “He did great, scored two and could have had more.” Six minutes in United were awarded a penalty for an Enzo Fernández stamp on Antony’s foot, Chris Kavanagh pointing to the spot after the VAR instructed the referee to consult the pitchside monitor. Here was a definite boon for Ten Hag’s men but Bruno Fernandes stepped up and saw his penalty saved by Robert Sánchez, Alejandro Garnacho blasting the follow-up over. It was not what a struggling United needed and, very soon, they nearly conceded. Sofyan Amrabat passed straight to Nicolas Jackson, who played in Mykhailo Mudryk. As the angle narrowed, the Ukrainian hit André Onana’s right post. Under the floodlights there was a pleasing tempo about the contest. And next United were particularly chuffed. Amrabat snaffled a loose Chelsea ball, tapped to Fernandes, he relayed to Garnacho, and when the ball went in and Harry Maguire’s effort was blocked it came to McTominay who, steadying himself, beat Sánchez to the latter’s left from close range. United were performing as Ten Hag would wish, pinning the visitors back and reducing their time on the ball. When Raheem Sterling fed Palmer and kept running along an inside‑right channel, the return was overhit. Silkier was a Garnacho pirouette that dizzied the dark-blue backline and allowed the winger to thread the ball in where Rasmus Højlund lurked. From United’s XI that lost on Saturday at Newcastle out had gone Kobbie Mainoo, Anthony Martial, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Marcus Rashford, which meant starts for Victor Lindelöf, Amrabat, Højlund and Antony. Ten Hag had his selection correct as United were as convincing as they have been this term. A Sánchez hoof straight out, as those in red cornered Chelsea’s rearguard, was as emblematic of their supremacy as the keeper’s scramble to repel a McTominay header – and follow-up – moments later. Suddenly, though, Sterling ran clear, teed up Jackson and this, surely, was the equaliser. But the maligned Onana’s reflexes were superb. United should then have been punished when Mudryk had all of the goal to aim at and missed. This pointed to United having to get more savvy or Chelsea would take advantage and they did. It was easy: Palmer collected, moved across the D, a passive Lindelöf watched, and the former Manchester City player rolled his shot into Onana’s far left‑hand corner, the keeper perhaps wrong-footed. For the second half Ten Hag removed Lindelöf for Sergio Reguilón and Mauricio Pochettino introduced Reece James for Marc Cucurella and it was the Argentinian manager’s switch that came close to the instant dividend. At a corner James rose and flicked towards Jackson, who should have scored but his point-blank header was skied. Luke Shaw had moved into Lindelöf’s central defensive berth to partner Maguire and Reguilón went to left-back. The Spaniard flew along his flank and saw a cross hit the first defender. The contest was poised. Both sides probed. Next, Palmer hit James whose zipping delivery had Shaw throwing a leg at the ball and United escaped. As did James when a Shaw piledriver hit a hand low down in Chelsea’s area: it may not have been a penalty but, these days, who knows? McTominay’s winner was a classic midfield schemer’s strike as he drifted into the area, Garnacho spied him, curved the ball in, and the Scot thudded a header past Sánchez. Old Trafford exploded in a cocktail of joy and relief and moments later the hat-trick was on but he scooped wide. United closed this win out to leave Pochettino in honest form. “They deserved to win,” the Chelsea manager said."
Villa,1,City,0,Leon Bailey fires Aston Villa to memorable win over Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/06/aston-villa-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-06,"For a while now Aston Villa have openly and confidently declared qualifying for the Champions League is their primary objective this season and, on this evidence, after defeating and disposing of Manchester City, they will be in the conversation for the long haul. Leon Bailey blasted Villa in front on 74 minutes and City could not argue it had not been coming on a chastening evening to forget for Pep Guardiola, whose side are now an unprecedented four Premier League matches without victory. Villa were fortuitous Bailey’s strike looped in via Rúben Dias but by that point they had more than created their own luck with a rip-roaring performance. By the end, City were on the ropes, Ederson reeling as his defence crumbled in front of him. Douglas Luiz, the former City midfielder, cracked a shot against a post late on as Villa hunted for a second. At full time, it was to wonder whether the thumping chorus of Villa’s adaptation of Jeff Beck’s Hi Ho Silver Lining has ever sounded this sweet. The deafening atmosphere was just one aspect of a memorable evening when the numbers told a revealing story. Villa had 22 shots to City’s two, seven of which were on target. Villa won the ball back 13 times in the opposition half, the most any team has done so in a league game against Guardiola’s City. At times it felt Villa were toying with the champions. At the final whistle John McGinn, the again magnificent Villa captain who conducted things from the heart of midfield, lay on his back after exhausting every sinew. Emiliano Martínez beat his chest in front of the Holte End. Often the pre-match pyrotechnics feel somewhat overkill – sometimes it can be hard to escape the notion that the occasion about to unravel before our eyes has been frankly overhyped – but this clash between sides third and fourth in the table, places they traded at full time, lived up to its billing as an absorbing contest. These days Villa represent formidable opposition full stop, but they are a particular force here; they have now won their past 14 home league matches. The place was rocking from the moment the players emerged from the tunnel. Put simply, City could not live with Villa’s intensity, insatiable press or downright gumption. If anything captured quite how uncomfortable a ride this was for the champions, it was the sight of Erling Haaland hurtling into Ederson’s 18-yard box to clear the ball to safety and avert another wave of Villa pressure. It was almost a case of anywhere will do, Haaland hooking the ball to halfway and straight back into Villa’s laps. The shot count at half-time was 13-2 in Villa’s favour, though the teams went in level despite the hosts’ dominance. Unai Emery marched down the tunnel, a few yards in front of Guardiola, who was embroiled in conversation with his assistant, Juanma Lillo. For Ederson, a chance for a breather. The omnipresent McGinn was the architect behind almost all of Villa’s good work and his audacious pass, sprayed from left to right amid seemingly little danger, was the catalyst for their first real chance. McGinn located Bailey and the Villa forward tested Ederson, leathering a bouncing ball goalwards. Ederson had to keep out a swerving Bailey strike and then he volleyed over from a sumptuous Lucas Digne cross. Ederson also saved smartly from Pau Torres. On the stroke of the interval, Douglas Luiz headed in from another fine Digne cross but the Villa left-back – just about – ran the ball out of play in the buildup. It was, of course, Haaland who went closest to scoring for City in a first half which they spent much of on the back foot. Martínez, who 12 months ago was en route to clinching the Golden Glove award in Qatar, repelled Haaland’s initial shot after the City striker latched on to a Phil Foden pass but when Bernardo Silva recycled the ball, the Argentina goalkeeper was again called into action. Silva stood up a cross to the back post and Haaland directed it goalwards, but Martínez pushed the ball clear with an incredible, instinctive two-handed save. Perhaps it was inevitable that the tempo would drop a little in the second half but there was always a sense that things were simmering beneath the surface. Haaland zig-zagged clear of three Villa shirts on halfway but delayed his pass for Foden and when he did release the ball it was too late and Foden was offside. John Stones’s failed Cruyff turn culminated in a Villa goal-kick. Rico Lewis was booked for tugging Douglas Luiz’s shirt. It was that kind of evening. City seemed to take the sting out of Villa until McGinn sent a cool right-foot effort dribbling inches wide of a post a few minutes after the hour. Silva cheaply surrendered possession and Bailey fed McGinn, who chopped inside Dias before sending a shot just off target. With 66 minutes on the clock, every City player was camped behind the ball, waiting for Pau Torres to pick his pass. Guardiola stood, hands clasped behind his back but the real pain was yet to come. Bailey eluded Josko Gvardiol and sent this stadium barmy."
Fulham,5,Forest,0,Fulham hit five past dire Nottingham Forest to pile pressure on Steve Cooper,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/06/fulham-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-06,"Even the most loyal of Steve Cooper’s supporters will know that there is unlikely to be any way back from Nottingham Forest’s latest capitulation on the road. Change is surely coming after Fulham, revelling in the return of their zest in the final third, pushed Cooper closer to the brink with a devastating performance. Fulham were outstanding, Alex Iwobi and Raúl Jiménez both scoring twice before Tom Cairney made it five, though they could not have asked for more obliging opponents. Forest, who have picked up four away points this season, barely competed. Their owner, Evangelos Marinakis, could be forgiven for leaving his seat in the directors’ box long before full time. Perhaps, after watching his side fall to their fourth consecutive defeat, he had some calls to make. It will not come as a surprise to Cooper if the sack follows. He apologised to Forest’s travelling fans at the end and could not believe they were still singing his name. “It’s embarrassing,” he said. “I’m grateful but I don’t deserve it. It’s embarrassing to think I can get that on the back of what they’ve seen.” Cooper did not gloss over Forest’s inadequacies, even accusing his players of not trying hard enough. “That spell where we gave away the two goals in the first half, we came away from the required technical and tactical levels to be competitive,” he said. “We didn’t recover with enough desire. “Pulling out of tackles, losing races, ending up on the floor in 50-50 combat – if you do that you have a night like tonight. The goals sum up the failings in the game. It’s one I take responsibility for. It’s on me.” The manner of Fulham’s opening goal captured the difference between the sides. Ibrahim Sangaré, who was no match for João Palhinha in midfield, paid a heavy price after coughing up possession in the 30th minute. Fulham’s aggression overwhelmed Forest. Cairney skipped past Felipe and Willian had time to deliver a cross from the left. Iwobi, ghosting behind Harry Toffolo, took advantage of Forest’s loss of shape by steering the ball in from close range. Forest’s soft centre cost them again four minutes later. Iwobi, buoyed by his second goal in three games, linked with Andreas Pereira, who released Jiménez. The striker gave Odysseas Vlachodimos no chance with an emphatic finish. Fulham purred. They made a slow start to the season but Marco Silva appears to have solved his side’s problems in front of goal. They have scored 11 times in their past three matches and they punished Forest again at the start of the second half. Pereira lifted a pass over the top and Jiménez outmuscled Ola Aina before rounding Vlachodimos and scoring with an indulgent back-heel. Forest’s defending was pitiful. There was no resistance as the substitute Harry Wilson crossed for Iwobi to score again. There was no attempt from anyone in red to track back when Fulham won possession and Cairney strode through to complete the scoring. Forest are in trouble."
Palace,0,Bournemouth,2,Moore seals Bournemouth victory at Crystal Palace as Roy Hodgson is booed,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/06/crystal-palace-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-06,"It may be unfair to suggest that the 76-year-old Roy Hodgson could learn a thing or two from Andoni Iraola, who is 35 years younger than the former England manager. But the manner of this impressive display that put Bournemouth level on points with Crystal Palace, with a third victory from their past four matches, suggests that the Spaniard in his first season of Premier League management was an inspired appointment. Palace were outplayed during the first half when Marcos Senesi headed the visitors ahead and could not respond before the substitute Kiefer Moore made sure of the points late on. It was a chastening defeat in front of an anxious home crowd that made their dissatisfaction clear throughout and particularly at the final whistle, when one appeared to throw an object at Hodgson as he left the pitch. The Palace manager is fortunate he already has so much credit in the bank although the patience of the club chairman, Steve Parish, will be tested if they continue to slide down the Premier League table having admitted before the game that “we want to push into the top 10”. “It was a very sad evening for us,” said Hodgson, whose side face Liverpool, Manchester City and Brighton in their next three matches. “The fact is that the expectations are high, hence the boos. But the fact is the fans have been spoiled here in recent times, they’re used to seeing us do very well at home and get good results and this year we’ve not been able to do that. I hope they have enough empathy to stick with us when times are tough.” With their struggles at home this season Palace have picked up just five points from seven matches and their intentions seemed clear when Jordan Ayew was denied twice by the Bournemouth goalkeeper Neto in the first five minutes. Yet having now taken 13 points from their past six, Bournemouth’s season has finally ignited under Iraola and they showed they would be no pushovers when Antoine Semenyo forced Sam Johnstone into a save. Poor marking from a corner allowed Senesi to nod them ahead from close range after the ball had been flicked on by Luis Sinisterra, with Jeffrey Schlupp guilty of playing the defender onside. There was worse to come for Palace when the left-back Tyrick Mitchell had to limp off with a muscle strain minutes later. Justin Kluivert was close to doubling Bournemouth’s lead after leaving Joel Ward in his dust on the Palace captain’s record 292nd Premier League appearance that he will want to forget. An exasperated Michael Olise was fortunate to escape a booking when he chased back 40 yards to commit a foul after Odsonne Édouard failed to read his through ball. Palace’s players were sent out early for the second half into the December chill, no doubt with their manager’s words ringing in their ears. Jefferson Lerma came close to equalising against his former club but his stinging shot was pushed on to the post by Neto. But that was pretty much it before – in a baffling substitution with 20 minutes to play – Hodgson decided against throwing on the £27m Brazilian winger Matheus Franca or the striker Jean-Philippe Mateta in preference to the defensive midfielders Naouirou Ahamada and Will Hughes. Instead, it was another substitute who made the difference when Moore rounded off a flowing Bournemouth move to seal a deserved victory. “We were really efficient and we are adding small things to the team that are very important,” a rightly satisfied Iraola said."
Brighton,2,Brentford,1,Jack Hinshelwood strikes to give Brighton victory over Brentford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/06/brighton-brentford-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-06,"There is often talk of clubs with a rich pedigree, but it was a player with an extended footballing heritage that made all the difference in a closely fought encounter here on Wednesday. First, Jack Hinshelwood cleared off the line when Brentford seemed sure to take the lead for a second time, and, scarcely two minutes later, it was Hinshelwood again whose assured header from close range gave Brighton a lead that they rarely looked likely to surrender. Hinshelwood, 18, is from the fourth generation of footballing Hinshelwoods, a family tree that includes Wally, his great-grandfather, and his father, Adam, who was four seasons into a nine-year spell at the Seagulls when Jack was born, 12 miles down the coast in Worthing. Having joined the Brighton academy as a seven-year-old, Hinshelwood was making his home debut after performing strongly in three recent appearances away from home. His graduation to the first team, including a full game in the Europa League in Athens last week, has been a silver lining for his manager, Roberto de Zerbi, as injuries have piled up, and De Zerbi could hardly have given him more of a build-up than to describe him this week as “like a son of Pascal Gross”. Hinshelwood was a shoo-in for player of the match and so, too, for a standing ovation as he was withdrawn with 17 minutes left. “It is an unbelievable feeling,” Hinshelwood said. “It was my first game playing here at the Amex in front of all these fans. And it was a brilliant feeling to get a standing ovation. I’m just delighted to get the win. The fans, players and manager have all shown great belief in me and I am just trying to repay them.” Hinshelwood changed the narrative of a match which had been, to that point, a near facsimile of the meeting in April, which played out as a breathless 3-3 draw. As they had last season, when they led three times, it was Brentford who opened the scoring after their opponents had looked to carry the greater threat. Bryan Mbeumo sent Jason Steele the wrong way from the spot after Jan Paul van Hecke tugged down Vitaly Janelt as he advanced on goal, but within minutes the Bees had again surrendered a lead. Hinshelwood and then João Pedro moved the ball swiftly from the right to Kaoru Mitoma on the left, and when he rolled it inside to Gross it was thumped across Mark Flekken and into the far corner. For the remainder of the half both teams probed in familiar style, looking to get forward at speed whenever possible, but the opening of the second half suggested that the home side had been reminded in the interval of the well-known mutual antipathy between their chairman, Tony Bloom, and his Brentford counterpart and former employee, Matthew Benham. Bloom has been known to take a seat with the away fans at the reverse fixture, and if he was somewhere amid the blue-and-white in the North Stand here he must have been delighted by the waves of Brighton pressure that started to bear down on the visitors’ goal. Gross found Mitoma with a clever ball soon after the restart but his cross could not quite reach João Pedro, as one attack followed another, but it was Brentford that came closest to regaining the advantage on 49 minutes. Gross, at left-back, was robbed by Frank Onyeka before Hinshelwood blocked Yoane Wissa’s shot on the line. Within two minutes, Brighton were ahead and the first of what could well be many moments to remember was being pasted into the Hinshelwood family scrapbook."
Sheffield,0,Liverpool,2,Dominik Szoboszlai seals Liverpool win but Sheffield United find steel,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/06/sheffield-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-06,"This was never going to be a game which defined Sheffield United’s Premier League survival hopes but, on the night one of their favourite sons returned to the Bramall Lane dugout, it felt like something on which to build. Victory against a Liverpool side firmly in the title race never felt remotely likely given how, on Saturday, United were humiliated at Burnley in a game that resulted in Paul Heckingbottom’s sacking. The result was the one most expected, with goals from Virgil van Dijk and Dominik Szoboszlai moving Liverpool to within two points of Arsenal at the top. But the manner of performance from the league’s bottom side will have given all those associated with the club hope for what lies ahead. Granted, Jürgen Klopp’s side were not at their best, but this was a United display filled with endeavour and commitment. They will have to replicate it in a devilish run of fixtures this month which includes meetings with Chelsea, Aston Villa and Manchester City to keep in the mix at the bottom. “I’m proud but it can’t be a one‑off,” Chris Wilder said. “We can’t just have the new manager bounce. We asked the question of Liverpool, we made it a difficult game and I’m a little disappointed we’ve not got a result out of it.” The hallmark of title contenders – not being at their best but still finding a way to win – was very much evident for Liverpool. They controlled large swathes of the game but lacked the cutting edge to which fans have become accustomed. That said, when Van Dijk opened the scoring as half‑time approached, you wondered if that would break United’s spirit and open the proverbial floodgates for Liverpool. That never materialised, with Szoboszlai only assuring victory in the final seconds with a cool finish. That meant they remain two points adrift at the top of the Premier League and firmly in the title picture as Christmas approaches. This wasn’t vintage Liverpool by any stretch but nights such as these, with the narrative so firmly framed against them in the midst of a hectic fixture pile‑up, can so often be the undoing of a side. The fact Klopp’s team passed the test underlined just what his players are capable of. “I’m really pleased with the result,” Klopp said. “I’m pleased with a lot of aspects of the game. I know we can play better football but at this time of the year you play, hopefully win, recover and play again.” His side have barely any time to recover, though, with the early kick-off on Saturday next, a trip to Crystal Palace. On the night when Klopp confirmed Joël Matip had ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament and will likely be out for the season, it was perhaps no surprise he appeared to take a swipe at the scheduling. “That’s unfortunately what I expected from the first second,” Klopp said of Matip’s injury on Prime Video. “You can say what you want but I cannot say what I want because that would be really difficult.” United certainly had their chances on the counter in a lively first half before the opening goal arrived. James McAtee was denied by a smart Caoimhin Kelleher save after Joe Gomez was dispossessed on halfway, before Cameron Archer was freed on goal. However, the forward took too long over his shot and was blocked by Van Dijk, who then volleyed home the opener six minutes later with a finish of which any of Liverpool’s front three would have been proud. But the expected onslaught from the visitors after half-time simply did not materialise. Wes Foderingham produced a wonderful stop to prevent Mohamed Salah on the volley, but that was the closest they came for a good while. Their opponents played their part in keeping things tense, too, with Wilder’s side offering plenty of hope they could potentially snatch an equaliser. In the end, though, their profligacy came back to haunt them in injury time as Darwin Núñez’s pinpoint cross was met by Szoboszlai, who calmly converted past Foderingham to secure the win. It was nervy, but it was ultimately job done for the visitors. At a time of the year when the fixtures come thick and fast, perhaps that is all you can ask for on nights such as these."
Luton,3,Arsenal,4,Rice’s injury-time header gives Arsenal win over Luton in seven-goal thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/05/luton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-05,"It was a performance of two faces by Arsenal on a night when they absolutely had to win; dropping points at relegation-threatened Luton is not a part of any championship portfolio. For longer than anybody connected to Arsenal will care to remember, it looked like being a tale of their defensive softness. That, and the steel and silk of Luton – all of their players bringing the former; Ross Barkley, the best player on the pitch, contributing the latter. In abundance. The man in the firing line for Arsenal was the goalkeeper, David Raya, with Amazon Prime becoming the latest broadcaster to show the obligatory cut-aways to the back-up, Aaron Ramsdale, sitting glumly on the substitutes’ bench. Raya was at fault for the Elijah Adebayo header for 2-2 at the start of the second half, failing to come for a corner with any conviction and just being overpowered by the Luton centre-forward. Yet much worse was to come. When Barkley drilled a low shot at goal, Raya was horribly slow to get down, allowing the ball to fizz underneath him for 3-2. Luton were buoyant. They had been determined to build on their previous two results at home – the draw against Liverpool and the win over Crystal Palace. Further reward looked on and the question was simple – what did Arsenal have by way of response? The answer, happily for them, was more attacking menace, more of the cutting edge that had characterised the performance. And they showed it until the very last. Luton thought they had a precious point. Arsenal had pushed after Kai Havertz’s equaliser on the hour but the last of the six additional minutes had been played and still the scores were level. Enter Declan Rice. It was Martin Ødegaard who whipped over the cross after Arsenal recycled a move with nerveless patience and there was Rice to flick a header into the far corner. Cue bedlam, with Mikel Arteta so overcome by the emotion that he was booked; his third caution of the season, meaning he will be banned from the touchline for Saturday’s trip to Aston Villa. Yet again, Arsenal had shown their never-say-die belief, making their punches count in the closing stages. They had previously won this season with late goals against the Manchester clubs and Brentford, while they could also count an 84th minute equaliser against Chelsea. This is more like the kind of thing that powers title challenges. There was never any way that Arteta was going to criticise Raya. He limited himself to saying that his team had to defend better as a group and that was certainly the case on Luton’s first goal for 1-1. Barkley had served notice of his intention to turn the game into a showcase for his poise and personality on the ball; an early Cruyff turn a highlight. But it was from a corner that Luton cancelled out Gabriel Martinelli’s opener. When they won it, the decibel levels in the stands rose sharply. When Gabriel Osho powered it home, we had lift-off. Martinelli’s marking was weak. Arsenal’s first lead of what turned into a thriller had not lasted long. It came when Thomas Kaminski scampered to his left to retrieve a loose Amari’i Bell back-pass and banged the ball out for a throw-in rather than a corner. Gabriel Jesus was quickly on to it and he immediately got Bukayo Saka in behind Alfie Doughty. Saka’s run was typically smart and so was the cutback after the burst. Martinelli’s first-time finish was angled into the far corner. Arsenal responded well to Osho’s goal. Jesus and Martinelli worked Kaminski from tight angles while Saka jinked inside and unfurled a curler for the far corner. The goalkeeper did very well to fingertip it away. Arsenal deserved their goal before half-time, which again stemmed from a move up the right. Ben White played a give-and-go with Saka; what a lovely return pass it was and how White put it on a plate for Jesus, the cross perfectly floated. Jesus’s unchecked leap was majestic. He could not miss with the header. Barkley looked like he was playing with his own ball at times. His technical quality shone brightly and it was a lovely pass that he pinged into Andros Townsend after the restart, the winger’s shot deflecting for a corner. Again, Luton brought the desire and aggression on it. Raya could not cope. He was bullied by Adebayo, who pushed away Rice and timed his leap. Barkley’s evening would get even better; Raya’s would deteriorate. Barkley had surged from halfway, carrying up the inside left, revelling in every caress of the ball when he cut across to Townsend and got it back on the left hand side of the area. A step-over, a swerve to the outside, a low blast. Raya felt the ball swoosh underneath him. Arsenal had previously conceded only three away goals in the Premier League all season. Back they came again. The equaliser was all about the presence of Jesus, who reached a high punt forward by Saka and held off Teden Mengi before picking out Havertz. Jesus was outstanding and so was Saka, the pair shimmering with menace throughout. Havertz had gone close with a header towards the end but it was not a night when Arsenal would fall short."
Wolves,1,Burnley,0,Hwang on target as Wolves bring Burnley crashing back to reality,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/05/hwang-on-target-as-wolves-bring-burnley-crashing-back-to-reality,2023-12-05,"This never felt like a game that would get the pulse racing but for Burnley it resembled a deeply demoralising defeat after the high of putting five goals past the Premier League’s bottom club a few days ago. Even in the immediate aftermath of their 5-0 trouncing of Sheffield United on Saturday it was hard to truly quantify the weight of victory and the more cynical were vindicated here. A tougher test was guaranteed in this game and Hwang Hee-chan’s neat first-half finish extended his fine goalscoring form and Burnley’s sorry away run. If there was any doubt that the rest of this season remains an uphill challenge then this was it, with Wolves coming out on top despite one of their more unconvincing performances under Gary O’Neil. “I thought it was a massive win for us because I’ve watched a lot of Burnley,” the Wolves head coach said. “They are very well organised and every team I’ve watched play them they have struggled to get up the pitch with the ball. It is disrespectful to just say [it is just] ‘job done’, because they won the Championship by a long way and spent £90m in the summer.” Hwang again made the difference for Wolves, his eighth league goal of the season towards the end of the first half proving the winner. Only Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah and Son Heung-min, Hwang’s South Korean compatriot, can better his tally this season. No wonder Wolves are keen for Hwang to sign a new long-term contract. “His numbers are really impressive,” O’Neil said. “Will he continue to score at this rate for the rest of the season? It would be an incredible effort to do so. When the ball falls to Channy in the penalty area, I have a really good feeling that the ball is going to end in the back of the net. It is no fluke.” Vincent Kompany enjoyed a glass of red wine after Burnley’s demolition of Sheffield United – they were the last of the 92 clubs in England’s top four tiers to taste victory on home turf this campaign – but he stressed it was straight back to business here. Everything was going well until 42 minutes, when Sander Berge was ambushed after collecting a pass from the centre-back Dara O’Shea 20 yards from the Burnley goal. Pablo Sarabia seized possession and Matheus Cunha freed Hwang, who quickly adjusted his feet and slotted the ball past James Trafford. Until that point it seemed Burnley – if anyone – would be the most likely to strike and light up a game short on quality. Burnley were buoyed by victory at Turf Moor but arrived intent on improving the worst away record in the division. Dan Bentley made a smart save to tip a Josh Brownhill effort round a post after Zeki Amdouni barged João Gomes off the ball. Jóhann Gudmundsson, on in place of the injured Luca Koleosho, teed up Jay Rodriguez for the first big chance on 38 minutes but Bentley repelled his effort before dealing with the rebound. O’Neil was infuriated that a double save was needed after a sloppy throw-in. “I’m glad you didn’t have a microphone on me at that point,” he said, raising a smile. If anything typified a difficult evening for Burnley, one that began with such promise, it was the sight of Hjalmar Ekdal wiping out Cunha on halfway as Wolves set about piling forward on the counterattack. Burnley lacked class in key moments and, while Wolves were far from impressive, in Hwang, Sarabia and co they have a clutch of players capable of delivering when needed. But it will take more than a draining eighth defeat in nine to puncture Kompany’s spirit. “I’m seeing a team that is alive, a team that is in games and that is fighting,” the Burnley manager said. “We believe that we have been in games for quite some time now. We have to believe that this will give us the results we need.”"
City,3,Spurs,3,Kulusevski rescues late draw for Spurs in six-goal thriller at Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/03/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-03,"In a game that was akin to a breathless five-a-side, Manchester City slipped from mastering Tottenham to a sloppiness that should, privately, infuriate Pep Guardiola more than Simon Hooper’s odd decision in added time to wave play on before the referee awarded a foul on Erling Haaland after the No 9 had sent Jack Grealish through. The decision led Haaland and his colleagues to surround the referee – which may provoke an FA charge against City for failing to control their players – but material to the title race is how the champions slip to three points behind Arsenal, 14 matches in. Dejan Kulusevski was the visitors’ hero. As this helter-skelter contest went into the added minutes, Brennan Johnson skated along the left and popped the ball into City’s area and the Swedish winger – via a shoulder – beat Ederson to make it 3-3. The draw means Ange Postecoglou’s side halt, admirably, a run of three consecutive defeats, and the champions have dropped six points from the last nine available. The last time they failed to win in three consecutive Premier League matches occurred March-April 2017 and so City can be characterised as having a wobble by their supreme standards. They are at Aston Villa on Wednesday, when Rodri and Jack Grealish are not available because of suspension after being booked on Sunday. Guardiola can be upset at Grealish as his yellow card was for a petulant kick of the ball. He was on for Jérémy Doku, who appeared to have picked up an injury, so this is another blow for City. In the merit column, though, Grealish did seem to have grabbed all the points when sliding home on 81 minutes. City’s No 10 certainly does not score enough – this was a first of the campaign – and it derived from Postecoglou’s intent that Ange-ball will not be affected whoever the opponents might be. Close to his goal, Yves Bissouma was pickpocketed by Rodri, whose pass went right to Haaland. The Norwegian, profligate throughout, slipped the ball over and Grealish finished. But City proved powder-puff, unable to hold the lead before, in a frantic finish in the extra minutes, Haaland thought he had again put Grealish in. This all came after a fine start by Tottenham as they scored the type of breakaway strike that is the textbook way to breach City. Kulusevski curved the ball over the champions high line for Son Heung-min. The Spurs captain was in a foot race with Doku meaning the latter’s jet-heeled pace would, surely, make this competitive but the Belgian lacked desire and Son skipped through to beat Ederson. Great start, sure, yet three minutes later – in the ninth – City equalised. It was direct stuff, too: Julián Álvarez pinged a free-kick in from the right and the ball brushed Haaland’s forehead and banged off Son and past a helpless Guglielmo Vicario. Next in a madcap passage 1-1 should have become 2-1 to City. After a Vicario pass to Emerson the defender flapped when cornered by Bernardo Silva. The Portuguese squared to Haaland who was at point-blank range yet he fluffed the finish. The Postecoglou blueprint features high lines, pressing, and front-foot attacking. Thus far his men were being pressed back near goal and hoping to thrive off breakaways. This is what City do to even the most determined plans. Tottenham’s opener came from the counter and a second nearly derived from the same ploy. Johnson left Rúben Dias flailing as he burned along the right but, unlike Doku, the Portuguese refused to give up and his recovery was admirable. Soon, Guardiola was displaying the diametric emotion on witnessing Silva pass straight to Bryan Gil who, near goal, might have scored. When City took the lead it came a little after a sweeping home move that ended in Doku crashing the ball off Tottenham’s crossbar. This time the Belgian’s part was to prod to Álvarez, who recycled to Phil Foden, who stroked in past Vicario. This had become a spectacle of City sequences and chances, forcing Tottenham into a frantic all-hands-on deck mode while seeming to not possess quite enough numbers to stem the relentless wave. So it was that Bissouma shipped the ball to Álvarez and when the Argentinian tapped to Haaland it had to be 3-1. But the master marksman blasted over, to his visible disgust. Postecoglou’s default expression was often one of disappointment – particularly when City escaped the squeeze, but this is one of their many areas of expertise. The Australian might have swapped it for relief as, at the interval, Spurs were only a goal behind so still harboured hope. After a talking-to, not “anger” Postecoglou claimed, Tottenham were a different proposition, aided by Pierre-Emile Højbjerg’s introduction for the second half, the Dane, on for Gil, solidifying Spurs. City, too, eased off the gas and it led to Giovani Lo Celso making it 2-2: Álvarez’s lazy flick was sloppy and intercepted by Ben Davies, Son was fed, he passed to the Argentinian, and the finish, at distance, was curled in off the base of Ederson’s right post. Grealish thought he had won it only for Kulusevski to intervene. Now came the grandstand – and controversial – finish, which began with Emerson Royal felling Haaland. We probably have not heard the end of it."
Chelsea,3,Brighton,2,Ten-man Chelsea hold on to beat Brighton after Enzo Fernández double,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/03/chelsea-brighton-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-03,"It is probably safe not to take Mauricio Pochettino’s description of himself as a university professor seriously. When this mess of a game was over Professor Poch was on the pitch, any illusion of thoughtfulness disappearing as he had a go at the officials, the elbow patches on his blazer well and truly off. Perhaps it is time for Todd Boehly to install a creche at Stamford Bridge. Pochettino was in charge of a class of unruly children during a performance that began with Chelsea in control and ended with Levi Colwill almost giving away a penalty in the 110th minute, tempers boiling over and Brighton almost snatching an unlikely point as chaos reigned. Control? Composure? Forget about it. Chelsea have the worst disciplinary record in the top flight and were almost too intense in their pursuit of their fourth Premier League home win in 2023. They were up for a fight after their collapse against Newcastle but were down to 10 men when their captain, Conor Gallagher, got himself sent off just before half-time. Pochettino loved his young side’s spirit. He needs to fix the naivety, though. “We have too many players who need to feel what it means to play in the Premier League,” Pochettino said, although he defended Gallagher and focused on the positives. “We needed to show our real face. We wanted to show we care.” The desire was captured by Thiago Silva making a crucial challenge as Brighton pushed for a late equaliser. Robert Sánchez made some important stops and the teams clashed after full time. “It is not just about your philosophy on the pitch,” Pochettino said. “You need to belong to the team. We needed this kind of game to challenge us.” Chelsea also needed some good fortune. Brighton fumed at the VAR intervention that allowed Enzo Fernández to score the hosts decisive third goal from the spot. Later they would despair when Colwill was penalised for handball with Chelsea defending a 3-2 lead deep into added time, only for replays to show that the ball had struck the left-back in the face. Jubilation turned to disappointment for Roberto De Zerbi, although Brighton’s manager chose not to complain about Chelsea winning a penalty for James Milner’s challenge on Mykhailo Mudryk. “I don’t want to speak about the referee,” the Italian said. “I didn’t see anything. I have to accept every decision.” De Zerbi accepted that Brighton conceded silly goals. Chelsea responded to Pochettino’s anger after the 4-1 defeat by Newcastle. Pochettino made four changes, with Cole Palmer a notable omission, and reacted to a shortage of full-backs by naming Axel Disasi at right-back. Chelsea were committed. Brighton, ravaged by injuries and weary after winning away at AEK Athens on Thursday, struggled to compete. It was too easy for Chelsea to play through midfield. Moisés Caicedo ignored the boos from the away end and offered control. Fernández was elusive. Raheem Sterling tested Brighton on the right. The breakthrough arrived when Gallagher delivered a corner. Benoît Badiashile gathered possession and hooked the ball into the six-yard box. Brighton were vulnerable without Lewis Dunk at the back. Nobody tried to stop Fernández from heading in his first goal in the Premier League. Soon it was 2-0. Nicolas Jackson headed Gallagher’s corner back into the middle and Colwill forced the ball over the line. It was the 20-year-old’s first goal for the club and it seemed that Chelsea were cruising, only for the mood to change when Adam Lallana found Facundo Buonanotte. One on one with Colwill, the winger cut inside and curled a beautiful shot past Sánchez. Chelsea could have been clear – Mudryk had gone close – but now their inexperience took over. They were down to 10 men when Gallagher, who was fortunate only to receive a yellow for a foul on Buonanotte, lost Billy Gilmour and received his second booking for taking the former Chelsea midfielder down from behind. It is worth remembering that Reece James, the club captain, was already unavailable after his dismissal against Newcastle. Pochettino has a problem. Silva took the armband but Caicedo was booked for kicking the ball away. Chelsea were edgy. Caicedo went close to being booked again and De Zerbi responded by introducing Kaoru Mitoma, João Pedro, Pascal Gross and Milner. Brighton were not stretching the 10 men. They lacked conviction and lost their shape after a corner. Jackson released Mudryk and Milner brought the winger down. Contact was slight, no more than a tangle of legs, but Craig Pawson gave a penalty after checking the pitchside monitor. Fernández extend Chelsea’s lead. Chelsea fell back. Brighton still had time. Sánchez made a stunning stop from Gross and Brighton pulled a goal back when João Pedro headed in Milner’s corner. Now the nerves took over. Colwill had his escape and sheer desire got Chelsea over the line."
Liverpool,4,Fulham,3,Alexander-Arnold lifts Anfield into delirium as Liverpool stun Fulham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/03/liverpool-fulham-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-03,"Things do not always have to go perfectly to create perfection as Liverpool found out, maintaining their 100% home record in a seven-goal thriller against Fulham. Trent Alexander-Arnold, albeit via Bernd Leno’s back, and Alexis Mac Allister scored two incredible goals from a combined distance of 55 yards to twice put Liverpool into the lead. But Fulham repeatedly fought back, netting through Harry Wilson, Kenny Tete and Bobby De Cordova-Reid, all from close range, before Wataru Endo and Alexander-Arnold lifted Anfield into delirium. It was rare that Alexander-Arnold was stationary on the pitch. He nominally started the game at right-back but could be found operating as a sweeper, in central midfield or at left-wing. When he did get a moment of calm, the full-back lined up a free-kick from 25 yards before curling in off the bar with the sweetest of strikes, although it will be slightly tainted as it hit Leno’s back on the way down. It was a positive day for Liverpool’s academy as the equaliser came from one of their graduates, too, four minutes later. It highlighted the downside to Alexander-Arnold’s free role, however, as it came down Liverpool’s right with their “right-back” in the centre of the penalty area. Joël Matip’s pass out of defence was intercepted and Fulham broke with Antonee Robinson allowed space to cross for Wilson, who jabbed the ball through Caoimhín Kelleher’s legs, the goalkeeper making his sixth Premier League appearance almost three years to the day since his first. Mac Allister is, in theory, Liverpool’s deepest-lying midfielder but he offers far more in that role than others in the league. He is more suited to an attacking position and Jürgen Klopp is happy to see him go forward. The Argentinian was lurking when a throw-in was headed into his path by Raúl Jiménez; a less confident player might have taken a touch with the ball bouncing before passing it on but Mac Allister unleashed a vicious shot that kept rising until it hit the top corner. There was a split second of silence before the roar as everyone inside Anfield was amazed by what they had witnessed. “If he stayed there two hours, he is not going to do it again,” said Fulham’s manager, Marco Silva, not that Mac Allister is concerned. Leno’s earlier injury meant nine minutes were added on in the first half. In the third of those Jiménez found a more productive use for a flick-on and nodded a corner into Tete’s path. The Dutch right-back, playing his first game since mid-September, controlled the ball but it seemed to get away from him, making Kelleher think he could claim it only to see Tete’s outstretched right leg divert the ball in. Liverpool thought they had been saved by the assistant referee’s flag but VAR confirmed there was no illegality, allowing a belated second celebration from the away end. The fluorescent yellow and orange squares did rescue Liverpool soon after when Tim Ream smashed in the rebound following a Kelleher save from João Palhinha’s header. There was no doubt the American defender, despite his finger wagging, was offside to ensure the half ended in parity. In the second, Mohamed Salah slipped a pass through for Darwin Núñez, who was sporting a new braided hairstyle, but his rifling shot struck the bar to help remove the rain. The Uruguay striker felt the need for greater backing from the supporters and threw his hands up to the Kop. The same duo combined soon after as Salah cushioned a Dominik Szoboszlai pass over the defence for Núñez but he could only scuff a shot wide. Alexander-Arnold’s passing range and the fact Liverpool looked susceptible down the right resulted in him being moved into central midfield and Joe Gomez coming on at full-back as Klopp withdrew Szoboszlai and Mac Allister. Cody Gakpo joined the architect of chaos Alexander-Arnold in midfield and the game opened up. Fulham were playing on the break and once again, despite the changes, it was Liverpool’s right that caused the hosts problems. Willian was left free to pull the ball back for Tom Cariney, who lifted a cross to the back post where his fellow substitute De Cordova-Reid rose above Kostas Tsimikas to head home and put Fulham into the lead for the first time. Salah, one away from his 200th Liverpool goal, should have levelled when a corner was parried straight into his path but he could not score from six yards out, blazing his volley well over the bar. Salah need not have worried as, from his pass, Endo popped up on the edge of the area to curl a shot into the top corner. It seemed only right Alexander-Arnold would have the final say. A Núñez cross was half-cleared out to the England international who fired home from 18 yards to create bedlam on the pitch and in the stands in the 88th minute. It was a glorious end to a glorious match."
Bournemouth,2,Villa,2,Ollie Watkins rescues point for Aston Villa with late strike at Bournemouth,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/03/bournemouth-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-03,"Just as it seemed Aston Villa would succumb to the kind of defeat that would stick in the throat, Unai Emery’s side salvaged a point at a rejuvenated Bournemouth courtesy of a deft Ollie Watkins header with second-half stoppage time looming. At the end of the season, if not sooner, this could feasibly rank as a healthy takeaway given the margins in their explicit quest to qualify for the Champions League. Zoom out to analyse the bigger picture and Villa, imperious on home turf, remain very much poised to challenge. Perhaps that backdrop explains the wild celebrations as Watkins registered his 11th goal in his past 15 appearances in all competitions. Watkins wheeled off towards the away support and Emery went berserk, legging it around his technical area punching the air with both hands. It was a magnificent equaliser to earn Villa a potentially precious point and maintain momentum. Watkins beat Ilia Zabarnyi to the substitute Moussa Diaby’s cross and twisted his head to generate enough power to beat the Bournemouth goalkeeper and captain, Neto. “These kind of players need just 20cm,” Andoni Iraola, the Bournemouth manager, said, acknowledging the beauty of the goal. “For sure, we can defend better but for me the key [to the match] was more the other side. We had chances to score a third goal and probably finish the game.” Until that point Watkins had been very much on the periphery, his off‑colour display symptomatic of a pale Villa display all round. Emiliano Martínez more than played his part in ensuring Villa departed the south coast with something tangible, twice saving superbly from Dominic Solanke, making almost identical saves in each half. Douglas Luiz grimaced when Ryan Christie sidestepped him and located Solanke on the edge of the six-yard box, only for Martínez to repel the striker’s shot with his torso. After the break, a relieved Martínez puffed his cheeks after denying Solanke when the striker latched on to a laser cross by the electric Marcus Tavernier, who carried the ball from halfway. With games against Manchester City and Arsenal on the horizon, a significant week given their aspirations this season, Villa at least avoided an ignominious start. Villa arrived as formidable opponents, soaring high with the league summit within sight, but twice pulled level to cancel out goals by the selfless Antoine Semenyo and Solanke. Semenyo again shone but was fortunate to avoid a cheap red card, tugging at Leon Bailey’s shirt after picking up an early yellow. Bournemouth have now played all of the top six and so Iraola seems well placed to judge Villa’s top-four credentials. Emery, for one, is determined to do more than just make noises about disturbing the division’s best. “I think they are elite in the final third, in the transitions, on the counter; whenever they have space to run with Diaby, Watkins, Bailey or whoever is playing on the left,” Iraola said. “They are really dangerous whenever they recover the ball, very good at set pieces and with these things you are always in the games. Even if you don’t play at your best, you are always a threat and this is the reason they score so many goals.” On the touchline, there was plenty of nervous energy as Iraola and Emery paced their technical areas. Emery is watchable at the best of times but grew more irritable as the prospect of moving second in the table – even if only momentarily – faded. A couple of minutes into eight minutes of first-half stoppage time Emery animatedly questioned John McGinn’s motives for dummying a routine pass, prompting a vocal exchange. Following the interval, once Solanke had regained the lead with a smart finish, Emery aired his anger when the referee Thomas Bramall halted play after Semenyo clattered into the advertising hoardings. The Villa manager’s ire was evident again when the Bournemouth left‑back, Milos Kerkez, gained a few yards with a throw-in on halfway. The referee was the subject of frustration from both sets of supporters at the interval. A VAR check, which disallowed Diego Carlos’s goal that would have put Villa 2-1 up moments after Bailey equalised, took four minutes to be completed. Lucas Digne, who beat Tavernier to a header in the buildup, was eventually ruled offside. By the end of a lively and feisty contest, it all rather felt a distant memory. The Villa substitute Jhon Duran clinked a post with an effort that deflected off Marcos Senesi but it was Bournemouth who will replay in their minds chances to seal victory. It is why Emery understandably adopted a pragmatic stance. “I think it was brilliant how we were trying to keep being consistent, never giving up and always trying to be in the match,” the Viilla manager said. “The resilience was on the pitch and in our mind. It is not the best result but we have to accept it.”"
West Ham,1,Palace,1,Odsonne Édouard cancels out West Ham’s early lead against Crystal Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/03/west-ham-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-03,"There are some games in which, you suspect, the two managers could have shaken hands on a draw before kick-off and nobody would much have minded. From the moment Odsonne Édouard levelled eight minutes after half-time, this felt sure to finish level, and all that was left was to go through the motions so as to fulfil the contract to provide 90 minutes for the Sky cameras. The growing number of empty seats on a dank, raw afternoon in east London suggested few who had paid for tickets felt a similar obligation. The two oldest managers in the league spent most of the second half standing almost motionless on the edge of their technical areas, hands thrust in pockets looking vaguely disgruntled, as though they were just counting down the seconds till they could drift off for a mug of cocoa and an episode of Matlock. Not until the 82nd minute did either manager make a change, Roy Hodgson blinking first and bringing on Jaïro Riedewald, eternal king of the bench, for Will Hughes. “It was a tough game for us,” David Moyes said. “A tight, tight Premier League game. We couldn’t play with enough personality, get the atmosphere going. We were down and couldn’t get the thing lifted.” West Ham had taken a 13th‑minute lead with a goal of misleading quality, James Ward-Prowse sweeping a cross‑field pass to Vladimir Coufal, whose first-time cross found Mohammed Kudus. His shot took a nick off Marc Guéhi on its way past Johnstone. But David Moyes, despite having three attacking midfielders and two centre-forwards on the bench, and despite the fact West Ham had returned from Serbia on Friday and looked weary, did not make a single change until the 88th minute when Pablo Fornals was belatedly introduced. Finally, there was some urgency, and Jarrod Bowen might have won it, but headed straight at Sam Johnstone from six yards out. It was probably Hodgson who was happier with the point, if only to stop a run of recent defeats. It would be an exaggeration to suggest he had been under pressure, but with this result Palace have now won just once in their past seven games. The gap to the bottom three remains at nine points but a defeat against Bournemouth on Wednesday, particularly with Liverpool and Manchester City next up, could start to induce twitchiness. “For a large period I was quite pleased with the way we were defending and attacking,” he said. “Then you have to go through the anxious moments of last five minutes of normal time and five minutes of added time. We’ve just lost two games to late goals. I could have done without that last 10 minutes. Had we lost to another late goal it could have had massive consequences for the team’s confidence.” Palace generally feel like a club in a search of a purpose. This is their 11th successive season in the Premier League, in which time they have been consistently lower mid-table. The two attempts to break the mould and inject something more progressive or exotic – Frank De Boer and Patrick Vieira, the latter having shown rather more promise than the former – have faltered and, while Hodgson saved them last season and has never been less than solid, it is hard to imagine anything other than more of the same as long he remains. But then what else can they be? Palace have the 11th-highest wage bill in the Premier League, so 11th is their natural level. Life for them is plugging away, almost certainly doing enough to survive, occasionally achieving a notable result – such as winning at Manchester United this season – and occasionally producing a gifted young player, to whom fans can never wholly give their hearts because they know that by their early 20s they will be off to clubs with a more realistic prospect of playing regularly in European competition. Only the three promoted sides went into the weekend having scored fewer goals than Palace, although there is some mitigation in that, after the departure of Wilfried Zaha, injuries have meant Hodgson has been able to start Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze together only once this season and that lasted just 49 minutes before Eze was forced off with an ankle injury. They did not look much like scoring here, set-plays their only real threat. When they did score, the sixth goal West Ham have conceded in the first 15 minutes of the second half since the beginning of October, it was gifted them by Konstantinos Mavropanos. “From our point of view, it was terrible,” said Moyes, who admitted he was concerned by the habit of conceding just after half-time but seemed at a loss to explain it. “We’re not going in and eating a pie and coming out and feeling rubbish,” he said. Édouard took the opportunity almost apologetically, squeezing it just inside the far post at a pace in keeping with the general torpor."
Burnley,5,Sheffield,0,Sheffield United fans turn on manager Heckingbottom after Burnley thrashing,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/02/burnley-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-02,"Paul Heckingbottom insisted he could hold his head up high after a number of fans turned on him following Sheffield United’s capitulation at Burnley. The odds on Heckingbottom becoming the first Premier League manager to lose his job this season tumbled after a humbling defeat, in which a Burnley side who started the day bottom of the table scored an opener through Jay Rodriguez just 15 seconds in and recorded their biggest top-flight win since 1970. Jacob Bruun Larsen doubled the lead and, with the Blades reduced to 10 men when Oli McBurnie was sent off before half-time, they crumbled in the second half with Zeki Amdouni, Luca Koleosho and Josh Brownhill helping Burnley end their wait for a home league win this season at the eighth attempt. “I bet they’re [the fans] nearly as angry as me,” Heckingbottom said. “But the one thing I can say is I can walk out of this stadium with my head held high. I know how hard I work for everyone at the club. I won’t change, I’ll make sure the staff do the same. And we continue to give everything we’ve got with what we’ve got. The fans are right to shout, say that wasn’t good enough. I was almost singing along with them at one point.” Given Burnley were two goals to the good at the time with United barely laying a glove on them, McBurnie’s red card in the first minute of stoppage time was hardly a turning point, but the Scot’s two yellow cards in the space of 10 minutes killed off any hope of a comeback. “He’s let me down,” Heckingbottom said. “He knows he has.” Burnley’s first home win and first clean sheet of the season lifted them off the foot of the table, and relieved some of the tension that has been building around Turf Moor. “I think we were so desperate to do it,” Vincent Kompany said. “We felt against (Crystal) Palace was good, against West Ham was good. You don’t know when it’s coming but I felt we always believed it was coming so for us hopefully it’s a starting point. “The performance today was really good but you have to turn it into results. I just hope with the goals they’ve scored today and the fact we had a lot of goalscorers as well, that’s an important sign with Lyle Foster still not being there.” Both of Burnley’s wins to date have come against sides they were promoted with during the summer. The challenge of taking points off established Premier League sides remains, starting at Wolves on Tuesday. “I’ll have a glass of red wine tonight and then back on to Wolves,” Kompany said. “When we win there’s only three days to enjoy it. But we go again. It’s the same recipe really. I see the boys making progress, they work as hard as the top teams in the league. They don’t get the rewards for it at the moment but now we move on to the Wolves game.”"
Newcastle,1,United,0,Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon punishes weary Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/02/newcastle-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-02,"The snow and ice blanketing Tyneside never melted all day while the evening temperature dipped well below freezing point but Newcastle remained far too hot for Manchester United to handle. Although ultimately only Anthony Gordon’s second half goal separated the pair, the narrow scoreline fails to reflect either the superiority of Eddie Howe’s players or the indifference of their often directionless guests. Erik ten Hag’s travel plans were disrupted when the freezing weather dictated that the plane scheduled to deliver his team to Tyneside could not reach Manchester after becoming stranded at an another airport. Although a different aircraft was dispatched to Newcastle in time to fly Manchester United home on Saturday night, the visitors could have done without a long, slow, tedious trans-Pennine coach journey. Given that his charges were in Istanbul last Wednesday, drawing 3-3 with Galatasaray and seven senior players are currently in the treatment room, Ten Hag could at least cite a litany of excuses for what represents a considerable setback to his currently seventh placed side’s ambitions. To be charitable, fatigue was possibly to blame for an early confusion-filled and slightly comedic cameo involving André Onana and Diogo Dalot. With communication evidently having broken down between the pair, the left-back rushed to intercept what looked to be a routine clearance for his goalkeeper. Arriving in haste he lifted the ball over an alarmed-looking Onana and seemed set to register an own goal before somehow hooking to safety. At one point in that ungainly manoeuvre the ball appeared to strike the defender’s arm but Dalot escaped unpunished. Had their keeper’s mistakes in Turkey unnerved Ten Hag’s rearguard? Maybe Dalot was simply discomfited by the ferociously relentless attacking zeal of Howe’s XI. Although a Newcastle side deprived of 11 first-teamers through injury or suspension and still recovering from Tuesday’s emotionally draining 1-1 draw at Paris Saint-Germain hardly have things entirely easy at present themselves, they dominated throughout. Admittedly there were odd moments when some wonderfully intelligent counterattacking passes delivered by the sometimes slackly marked Bruno Fernandes threatened to undo Howe’s team but they represented rare exceptions to the general trend. Onana, goaded horribly by the Gallowgate End, proved his worth by saving smartly to deny Miguel Almirón following Joelinton’s adroit cutback. Meanwhile Alexander Isak saw a shot deflected wide by Harry Maguire, Bruno Guimarães went close from just outside the area, Jamaal Lascelles headed wide from six yards and Kieran Trippier’s wickedly swerving free-kick hit the bar. Despite Fernandes’s best efforts – and you wonder what Ten Hag would do without his talismanic midfielder’s improvisational vision – precious little was seen of Manchester United as an attacking force. An effectively sidelined Marcus Rashford certainly looked increasingly frustrated at being persistently second‑guessed by Howe’s once-again immensely impressive left-back, Tino Livramento. This was the first time Ten Hag’s starting XI had begun a match together and their rather disjointed, less than cohesive, display did nothing to camouflage the resultant lack of familiarity. Even so, the lack of a discernible strategic framework around Fernandes prompted questions as to whether the former Ajax manager remains overly reliant on individuals changing games courtesy of moments of off-the-cuff brilliance. With Newcastle pretty irrepressible this was more a night for indefatigable defending and Luke Shaw, deployed at centre-half, made some important blocks and interceptions. Unfortunately Shaw and co suffered a concentration outage as the unmarked Gordon swept Trippier’s cross home at the far post after Guimarães unhinged Ten Hag’s back door. Manchester United’s manager shook his head but he could hardly argue that the goal was either unmerited or unexpected. He responded by replacing Rashford and Anthony Martial with Antony and Rasmus Højlund. They swiftly saw their side survive a handball penalty appeal after Lewis Miley’s shot was blocked by Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Howe’s joy at another mature performance from 17-year-old Miley was tempered when his goalkeeper Nick Pope sustained a nasty looking shoulder injury and was replaced by Martin Dubravka. Almost immediately Antony volleyed beyond the newcomer but the ball took a deflection off an offside Maguire, the “equaliser” was disallowed and, thanks to a third successive win against Manchester United, Newcastle rose to fifth."
Forest,0,Everton,1,McNeil’s superb strike gives defiant Everton vital win at Nottingham Forest ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/02/nottingham-forest-everton-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-02,"Dwight McNeil’s first goal of the season enabled Everton to extend their impressive away record and move to within two points of the safety zone as they showed their off-field fight against their 10-point penalty will be matched on the pitch. The left winger scored with a superb shot with the outside of his boot midway through the second half as Everton won their third successive away match in the Premier League, making it 13 points from seven games on their travels. The result should give their supporters belief that their top-flight status can be secured, regardless of the outcome of their appeal against the penalty for breaching the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules. Forest, with only victory in 10 matches, failed to find enough “guile and creativity” according to their manager, Steve Cooper. Heart and soul may not be enough if they cannot re-find their rhythm, especially now they have misplaced their unbeaten home record over these past two games. Trips to Fulham and Wolves this week are looking significant for Cooper. “We shall not be moved” sang the Everton fans in the Bridgford Stand after the final whistle and Sean Dyche is urging them to keep the faith as they await the result of the appeal, which is likely to come next month. “What do you do until there’s more news?” the Everton manager said. “We spoke with the players. It’s out of our control so we’ll control the controllables and one of them is us, with the mentality to perform. “To get that first win after that news is very pleasing. It blows belief into the fans, into the group, into the players, because they still have to look at the table at some point. We have to wait and see what an appeal will bring, so in the meantime we’ve got to get on with business.” Everton appeared to be lacking a cutting edge with Dominic Calvert-Lewin out with a muscle injury. His replacement, Beto, half-volleyed over the crossbar after Odysseas Vlachodimos, duelling with McNeil, failed to get a clean punch on James Tarkowski’s long ball down the middle during the first half. Forest rallied, with Anthony Elanga swivelling to shoot just wide, Morgan Gibbs-White striking an effort into the side-netting and Felipe, on as a half-time substitute for his first appearance of the season, nudging a shot against the outside of a post early in the second half. But they did not manage an effort on target until Murillo’s shot was palmed aside by Jordan Pickford in the 87th minute. They also continued to look vulnerable, with Abdoulaye Doucouré revelling in the space he found behind the Forest midfield. Murillo had to clear off the line from McNeil before the winger struck midway through the second period. Everton had continued to press with a barrage of crosses. Most of them were headed away as Forest defended doughtily. But then Jack Harrison exchanged a one-two with Idrissa Gueye down the right and saw his deflected cross reach McNeil coming in from the opposite flank. There was scant cover as the winger swerved a superb half-volley into the far top corner. Dyche knows all about McNeil’s quality from their time together at Burnley. “He’s been terrific in his work ethic, which is something we ask of all of our players,” the manager said. “And I know he’s got ability and he showed that today, not just with his goal, which was a fine strike, but other parts of his game: his control and his understanding is improving all the time. But that’s built on the fact that he will do the hard yards to do well for the team, and they are good qualities to have.” Forest went for broke, as they had to, deploying Callum Hudson-Odoi and Elanga as wing-backs with Orel Mangala sitting in front of a back three. But Everton love this kind of situation; they have not lost under Dyche after scoring first. They were not about to change that narrative now."
Arsenal,2,Wolves,1,Martin Ødegaard sparkles as Arsenal edge past Wolves to extend lead at top,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/02/arsenal-wolves-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-02,"There is something stirring in the red half of north London. A clinical victory – Arsenal’s fourth in all competitions – thanks to two early goals from Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard sent Mikel Arteta’s side four points clear at the top of the table and strengthened their quest to seal a first league title for two decades. After a slow start that still left them within touching distance of the other contenders, Arsenal are now clicking into gear and it is no coincidence that their return to goalscoring form has coincided with Ødegaard’s return from injury. The Arsenal captain was in sparkling form against a Wolves side who never stopped running for manager, Gary O’Neil, but ultimately could not respond to their opponents’ show of quality inside the opening quarter of an hour despite a late consolation for Matheus Cunha after a mistake from Oleksandr Zinchenko that sparked a frantic finale. “Every player has his strengths and weaknesses but Oleksandr gives us so many positive things,” said Arteta of the full-back’s error for the goal when he surrendered possession on the edge of his own box. “This kind of thing can happen to any player and we have to learn from it. But we will get better.” Both former midfielders who are now managers, Arteta and O’Neil have formed an unlikely friendship over their careers and even bumped into each other while they were staying in the same hotel during the winter break for last year’s World Cup. Before kick-off there was a show of mutual appreciation but the Arsenal manager returned to his dugout with a steely focus in his eyes that indicated his team meant business. The destruction of Lens here on Wednesday when Arsenal were 5-0 up by half-time had whetted the appetite among supporters for more goals and it only took six minutes for Saka to oblige. The England forward was allowed to wriggle out of a tight space on the touchline and found Gabriel Jesus before sprinting into the box on to a return pass from Takehiro Tomiyasu and finishing with his right foot. It was the first time Arsenal had managed to score inside the first 15 minutes of a Premier League game at home this season and they had soon doubled that tally thanks to Ødegaard. A fantastic one-two between Jesus and Zinchenko was the catalyst for the goal, with the Ukraine full-back’s cutback played perfectly into Ødegaard’s path to sweep home from 14 yards. It was breathtaking stuff on a freezing afternoon in north London. Wolves had returned to the capital still smarting from the 3-2 defeat to Fulham on Monday after a controversial late penalty in their latest run-in with VAR. But there was no respite for them as Leandro Trossard could have made it 3-0 had it not been for a good save from José Sá. That proved to be the Wolves goalkeeper’s last act as he was replaced by Dan Bentley with what O’Neil confirmed was a back injury. While Arsenal may not have been at their rip-roaring best in attack so far the season, their defence has been much more reliable and the partnership between Gabriel and William Saliba handled the dual threat of Cunha and Hwang Hee-chan with ease at times during the first half. Only a lapse of concentration from Zinchenko when he was caught on the ball by Nelson Semedo provided a moment of alarm but Gabriel Martinelli was able to cover. Within seconds, the Brazilian was down the other end and striking an effort that came back off a post before Jesus spurned two great chances to put the game out of reach. Another mistake from Zinchenko then almost handed Wolves a lifeline as he misjudged a backpass but David Raya was out quickly to deny Hwang. Complacency seemed to be the only threat to Arsenal and they came out for the second half intent on finishing off Wolves but couldn’t quite manage it. O’Neil’s side had scored in 12 successive league matches since losing to Manchester United in the season’s opening round of fixtures and were far more of a threat after the break. Yet it wasn’t until another lapse from Zinchenko three minutes before full-time that they finally broke through, with Cunha’s arrowed finish giving Raya no chance. A wonderful piece of skill from Ødegaard to set up substitute Eddie Nketiah should have finally settled the home side’s nerves but the striker’s effort cannoned back off a post. O’Neil hoped his side might be given a penalty in stoppage time when Semedo’s cross was blocked by Gabriel, but, this time, he could have no complaints as a relieved Arsenal hung on. “We managed to stay in the game and create a nervous ending for Arsenal so the lads should take a lot from that,” said the Wolves manager."
Brentford,3,Luton,1,Neal Maupay and Ben Mee on target as Brentford ease to win against Luton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/02/brentford-luton-premier-league-match-report,2023-12-02,"Luton’s limited gameplan worked for 45 minutes but Brentford’s undoubted superiority was rammed home in the second half during their dominant victory. Brentford bombarded their opponents with 27 shots and the final score was the least they merited against a team that showed a whiff of attacking ambition only during the final 20 minutes. Despite controlling the first half, Brentford had to wait for the breakthrough, with the striker Neal Maupay scoring his second goal since returning to the club. Ben Mee’s deflected header doubled their lead but the substitute Jacob Brown scored from a rare Luton attack. Any hope of a comeback was quickly snuffed out with Shandon Baptiste adding a deserved third goal for Brentford. Thomas Frank, Brentford’s head coach, said: “I’m very pleased with the overall performance. It showed we are going in the right direction, with adding the next layers to the team. We can have one gameplan against a top team like Arsenal and then against Luton we handled a different challenge. “It’s not just about possession, we had over 70 % but more importantly is 27 shots which is very impressive. The counter-pressing and pressing was phenomenal.” Rob Edwards had no complaints about the result but was frustrated by the goals his team conceded. The Luton manager said: “They deserved the win. We’ve gone away from giving gifts away recently but we did that today. It was a bit of an off day for us with the ball. We were good without it, but not with it.” Brentford dominated possession early on but Luton’s defensive tactics limited their space to attack. Christian Nørgaard sent in a long throw that was flicked on by Ethan Pinnock but Maupay’s header was straight at the goalkeeper, Thomas Kaminski. Brentford were starting to look more threatening and Bryan Mbeumo, arguably their most dangerous attacker, cut inside from the right touchline but his shot from the edge of the area flew high and wide. Mbeumo again threatened from a direct run towards the goal, but his fizzing strike flicked off a defender and out for a corner. The pressure was mounting towards the break with Yoane Wissa’s strike from distance spilled initially by Kaminski before he gathered the ball. Luton offered nothing in the final third in the first half – failing to record a single shot – and were starved of the ball in a one-sided encounter but Brentford needed to be patient after failing to break them down. Tom Lockyer was forced off at half-time, with Brown replacing him, after the Luton captain picked up a back injury during the first half. The defender’s fitness is a concern heading into home fixtures against the top two, Arsenal and Manchester City, over the next week. Luton had not managed a clean sheet all season and their hopes of an overdue shutout lasted four minutes into the second half. Mee’s shot ricocheted off Amari’i Bell, but the ball fell kindly to Maupay and the Everton loanee converted from close range. Tahith Chong was booked for dissent after claiming he was fouled in the buildup to the goal. Brentford were in control and quickly doubled their lead. Mee’s header from Mbeumo’s corner was deflected in off Carlton Morris to leave Luton in trouble. It was no surprise when Andros Townsend was introduced alongside the striker Elijah Adebayo on the hour mark. Out of nothing, Ross Barkley released Brown and he showed composure to drift infield and place a low shot past Mark Flekken, to give Luton hope of an unlikely comeback. It was Brown’s second goal from off the bench in a week after scoring the winner against Palace at Kenilworth Road. Brentford did not panic and sealed the victory with a third after the substitutes Keane Lewis-Potter and Shandon Baptiste combined. Lewis-Potter’s low shot was parried by Kaminski, but Baptiste reacted quickest to fire home from close range. Luton thought they had scored a second goal in the 90th minute but Chong’s header from Townsend’s cross was ruled out for offside. Brentford should have added a fourth goal deep into injury time but the lively Lewis-Potter blasted over from six yards."
Fulham,3,Wolves,2,Gary O’Neil laments VAR after Willian’s two penalties help Fulham beat Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/27/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-27,"At this stage Gary O’Neil could be forgiven for wondering if VAR has been designed purely to drive him mad. Clear and obvious? All that was beyond debate when Harry Wilson tumbled over João Gomes’s outstretched leg in added time was that the Fulham substitute had taken advantage of the Wolves midfielder’s naivety. It was barely a challenge from Gomes and Fulham could hardly have cried foul if Michael Salisbury’s decision to wave play on had stood. But there would be interference from Stockley Park. There was slight contact from Gomes; enough to make Stuart Attwell send Salisbury to the pitchside monitor. Wilson had played it beautifully, tumbling theatrically. Fulham, seeking their first win in five league matches, needed the points. There was no holding back when Willian, who had already scored one contentious penalty early in the second half, lifted Marco Silva’s side 10 points above the bottom three by firing a low spot-kick past José Sá. Craven Cottage roared. Fulham had done their best to blow it. As their problems in front of goal faded during a performance full of flair, so did their ability to defend. Twice they led and twice they were pegged back. Matheus Cunha met Alex Iwobi’s early opener with a fine equaliser for Wolves midway through the first half and the outstanding Hwang Hee- chan, who made it 2-2 from the spot with 15 minutes left, ran Tim Ream ragged at times. Even so Silva could argue that he deserved a reward for refusing to settle for a point. Fulham were vulnerable without the suspended João Palhinha patrolling midfield and did not even convince after going ahead for the third time. There was still time for Hwang to volley inches over. Fulham’s relief was vast. And yet the enduring image was still O’Neil stalking off at full time, a look of pure thunder on his face. Already this season Wolves have been on the wrong end of pivotal decisions against Manchester United, Luton, Newcastle and Sheffield United. Points have been lost and apologies have been handed out. Three referees have been demoted to the Championship after hurting Wolves with inexplicable blunders. Attwell and Salisbury may be next. O’Neil even revealed that Salisbury had told him that he should have been advised to have another look at Fulham’s first penalty, given after Nélson Semedo was deemed to have fouled Tom Cairney. The Wolves manager had a litany of complaints. He could not understand how Ream had avoided a second booking when he brought down Hwang for his penalty. He was even more baffled about Carlos Vinícius staying on the pitch after appearing to head-butt Max Kilman in the 87th minute. “I’ve been in to see the referee,” O’Neil said. “He regrets the fact he’s not been sent to the screen to overturn the first penalty and he thinks he would have overturned it from the images he’s seen. Ream should receive a second yellow card. We then discussed the head-butt. He debated that and he said it was a soft head- butt. I said that’s crazy. “They’ve since sent a representative saying it should have been a red. The Wilson one, they think they’ve got right. I disagree. There’s minimal contact. I don’t think there’s enough. I feel for the fans. We’re probably seven points down. You can say sorry, you can send me flowers, but we should be on 22 points.” The shame was that the latest refereeing escapade diverted the focus from a thrilling contest. Silva reacted to Palhinha’s absence by replacing the midfielder’s steel with Cairney’s silk. Fulham led when Iwobi linked with Willian, who released the overlapping Antonee Robinson. The left- back crossed and Iwobi was free to score his first goal for Fulham. Wolves struggled without the suspended Craig Dawson in defence. But while Fulham went close to extending their lead through Raúl Jiménez and Cairney, gaps soon appeared at the other end. There was a warning in the 14th minute, Mario Lemina advancing and releasing Hwang, whose shot hit the bar. Then Jean-Ricner Bellegarde found space on the right. He beat Robinson once, then beat him again before crossing for Cunha to head past Bernd Leno. Wolves had recovered from their left wing-back, Rayan Aït-Nouri, limping off. They were making Fulham look soft and pressed for a second before half-time. Fulham needed to prise control of midfield away from Bellegarde, Lemina and Gomes. There was more urgency at the start of the second half. Fulham stopped Wolves playing out from the back and Cairney turned into a destroyer, dispossessing Lemina with a crunching tackle that allowed Andreas Pereira to start another attack. Cairney took charge and went over Semedo’s challenge. Salisbury pointed to the spot and Attwell had a long look before Willian restored Fulham’s lead. Wolves responded. Their belief grew after Sá made a crucial stop from Iwobi. They were level again when Calvin Bassey’s poor clearance dropped to Hwang. Ream, already on a booking, brought him down. Hwang converted the penalty. It seemed it would end in a draw. Wilson, on as substitute, had other ideas. The assist went to the man at Stockley Park."
Everton,0,United,3,Garnacho acrobatics spark Manchester United and douse Everton’s fire,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/26/everton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-26,"Everton burned with a sense of injustice over the record 10-point deduction that has revived relegation fears just when it seemed Sean Dyche’s side had left them behind. Manchester United performed with cool heads and cold intent instead, and savoured the biggest win of their improving season as a result. United’s previous seven league wins this season had all been by a single‑goal margin but here, against an Everton team reeling from the heaviest sporting sanction in Premier League history, an ultimately comfortable victory was built on character plus the clinical touch that their opponents lack. A stupendous overhead kick from Alejandro Garnacho set Erik ten Hag’s team on their way to an impressive win in which the 18-year-old Kobbie Mainoo excelled on his full debut. A second-half penalty from Marcus Rashford proved pivotal in taking the game away from Everton. Anthony Martial provided the gloss with his first goal of the season late on. Dyche’s team created a host of good chances – they had 24 attempts on goal compared to United’s nine – and adapted well to the unique circumstances that have enveloped the club. But finishing deserted them yet again at Goodison Park. Everton are five points from safety and cannot allow themselves to become demoralised by a punishment not of their players’ making. “The message to them is, we can cry and worry about it and say it is unjust, and I think the whole of football thinks it is unjust,” the Everton manager said. “Or we get on with it. We can’t guarantee the appeal, only what we can do about it each week on the pitch.” Everton protests against the Premier League were well funded, with more than £40,000 raised for the various banners and 38,000 pink cards that filled Goodison Park, impressively coordinated and executed en masse. There was a wild atmosphere inside the old ground with boos starting as soon as two men stepped on to the pitch carrying Premier League signage before kick-off. But what an angry crowd and a fired‑up team could not legislate for was an early moment of sheer brilliance from Garnacho. His wondrous overhead kick drew the sting from Everton’s ire, temporarily, and provided an emphatic reminder of the individual talent at Ten Hag’s disposal. For all the angst that surrounds United’s season they are now the league’s in-form team since the beginning of October with five wins from six matches and 15 points. Confidence is one thing Garnacho does not lack, as he confirmed after only 136 seconds. Everton were exposed by a cross‑field pass from Victor Lindelöf out to Rashford on the right. It would not be the only occasion. Rashford released Diogo Dalot to the by-line and, though his deep cross was sailing away from the danger zone, Garnacho read its flight to perfection. Taking a step back, and turning away from goal, the teenager launched himself into the air to meet Dalot’s delivery with an unstoppable overhead kick that flew into the top corner of Jordan Pickford’s goal with the Everton goalkeeper well beaten. The contender for goal of the season was reminiscent of Wayne Rooney’s spectacular winner for United against Manchester City in 2011. It was no surprise to hear United fans reprising their old Rooney chant moments later. Garnacho’s goal stunned Everton but gradually their composure on the ball improved to match their intensity. The hosts created enough chances to have led by the interval. Dominic Calvert-Lewin met James Garner’s corner with a towering header that he placed too close to André Onana. The Everton striker forced a better save from the United keeper with a first-time shot and Dwight McNeil was close to converting the rebound only for Mainoo to clear off the line. The 18‑year‑old was hugely impressive on his first Premier League start and demonstrated why Ten Hag had such high hopes for the central midfielder before injury struck in pre‑season. He denied McNeil again with a fine block when the Everton winger found space inside the United area. Abdoulaye Doucouré and Idrissa Gana Gueye, goalscorers in the win at Crystal Palace before the international break, were both guilty of glaring misses as Everton increased the pressure before half-time. Goodison’s anger turned towards the referee, John Brooks, after a series of inconsistent decisions, including booking Doucouré for dissent when asking why Garnacho was not cautioned for kicking the ball away. Everton’s sense of grievance deepened when Brooks awarded United a penalty after a pitch‑side review. The referee initially booked Martial for diving over Ashley Young’s outstretched right foot as he darted into the area. VAR advised Brooks to take a second look and he deemed Martial to have been tripped by the veteran defender. Bruno Fernandes showed a captain’s touch by giving the penalty to Rashford in a bid to boost the striker’s confidence. He duly smashed only his second goal of the season into the top corner. Martial wrapped up victory at the end of a flowing United move instigated by the substitute Facundo Pellistri. Fernandes dissected the home defence for the forward to lift a nonchalant finish over Pickford and claim his ninth goal in 17 appearances against Everton. He is not the only one whom Everton believe has it in for them."
Spurs,1,Villa,2,Ollie Watkins delivers clinical edge in Villa win and third straight loss for Spurs,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/26/tottenham-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-26,"Sometimes it is easy to be led by the scoreboard. This was a pulsating battle between two clubs energised by smart managerial appointments and there is a temptation to argue that the turning point came when Aston Villa somehow went in level at half-time, allowing Unai Emery to bend the game to his will with a double substitution that gave a previously rampant Tottenham Hotspur more questions to answer during the second half. It was proactive management from Emery, who was too cute to be fooled by Pau Torres hauling Villa level in the seventh minute of added time. Doing nothing would have been complacent. Tottenham had dominated, Giovani Lo Celso putting them ahead, and they could have been out of sight at the end of the first half. “Any other day we probably win comfortably,” Ange Postecoglou said. “It’s fine margins in football.” Postecoglou and Emery both thought of the missed chances. Given a chance to regroup the Villa manager duly responded, Youri Tielemans and Leon Bailey replacing Moussa Diaby and Matty Cash, and the decisiveness was most evident when the winner arrived in the 61st minute. After all it was Tielemans who played the pass when Ollie Watkins, who was keen to put a disappointing display for England behind him, scored the goal with which Villa took fourth place from Spurs and moved to within two points of the top of the table. Yet, while Watkins’ 12th goal of the season meant Villa set a club record of 22 Premier League wins in a calendar year, Emery refused to get carried away. There was no talk of a title challenge. Instead, there was realism from Emery, who said seven clubs have a better chance than Villa of finishing in the top four. Perhaps that was why Postecoglou stayed positive after his side’s third consecutive defeat. The Australian would have been more concerned if Spurs, who will surely improve once key players return from injury, had played within themselves on a day when they remembered their former midfielder and manager, Terry Venables, after he died at the age of 80. The action was frenetic from the start. Destiny Udogie and Dejan Kulusevski threatened for Spurs, the latter hitting the woodwork, while Villa looked dangerous from crossing positions. Torres, all alone from John McGinn’s free-kick, was aghast to send a free header wide. Spurs respected their attacking heritage. Before kick-off they remembered Venables, who won the FA Cup as a Spurs player in 1967 and as their manager in 1991, while the walk down memory lane continued when the teamsheets arrived: Postecoglou had channelled his inner Ossie Ardiles by selecting a back four of full-backs, named one defensive midfielder and given Bryan Gil and Lo Celso their first starts in the league this season. It was terrific fun. Spurs pushed, Gil testing Emiliano Martínez, and kept trying to breach Villa’s risky high line. Ezri Konsa was struggling at right-back and Villa conceded. Pedro Porro’s corner from the right bounced through a mass of bodies and the ball came to Lo Celso, who was alone on the edge of the area and free to score with a shot that went in off Diego Carlos. Kulusevski almost made it 2-0 and Son Heung-min had a goal disallowed. Spurs were overwhelming Douglas Luiz and Boubacar Kamara in midfield and Emery’s use of Cash in an advanced position was not working. The right‑back’s only notable contribution was being booked for the foul that forced Rodrigo Bentancur to go off 32 minutes into the Spurs midfielder’s first start since February. Yet Villa rallied. Spurs were vulnerable with Eric Dier unable to start and Ben Davies and Emerson Royal filling in for Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven in central defence. There were no leaders at the back and Villa thought they had levelled moments after Lo Celso’s goal, only for a lengthy VAR check to show that Watkins had strayed offside when he headed Lucas Digne’s cross past Guglielmo Vicario. No matter. Villa’s crosses were causing damage and they soon had a straightforward equaliser. Douglas Luiz delivered a free-kick from the right, Davies lost Torres and the defender headed home. Not that Emery was happy. The mood changed when he brought Bailey on for his running and Tielemans for his passing. Villa were more secure on the right, though Spurs still threatened, Brennan Johnson almost converting Kulusevski’s cross. Yet Spurs were nervous without the ball, especially with Pierre‑Emile Højbjerg a less effective shield than Bentancur. Gaps appeared and Villa advanced. Bailey almost embarrassed Vicario and it was not long before Villa were ahead. Bailey found Watkins and after playing a one-two with Tielemans the striker ran through to squeeze a shot past Vicario. Spurs, missing the creativity of James Maddison, refused to give up. There were chances for Porro, Davies, Johnson and Højbjerg but Martínez was in inspired form. Villa had done enough. While Emery was grateful for the options on his bench, Spurs felt their lack of depth come back to bite them. Postecoglou was able to name only eight substitutes, including two goalkeepers, and he knew it was not going to be his day when Son had another goal disallowed."
Sheffield,1,Bournemouth,3,Fans turn on Sheffield United as Marcus Tavernier double lifts Bournemouth,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/25/sheffield-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-25,"Marcus Tavernier fired a double as Bournemouth dismantled Sheffield United to maintain their resurgence under Andoni Iraola. Tavernier struck early in both halves, his brace sandwiching Justin Kluivert’s first Premier League goal. Substitute Oli McBurnie headed a stoppage-time consolation for the Blades, who remain in the relegation zone after a 10th defeat in 13 league games. Bournemouth, high on confidence after a 2-0 win over Newcastle in their previous game, cruised to their first league win on the road this season and the margin of victory could easily have been wider. After seeing his side sweep the Blades aside, Iraola was delighted with Tavernier’s contribution. He said: “He was playing really well in the last games but he had some chances he didn’t finish, against Burnley and Newcastle. “But it was a matter of time because he has the quality. It’s good he gets the reward because he is contributing in such different ways to the team. I’m really happy for him.” Tavernier, who missed the first month of the campaign through injury, scored five Premier League goals last season. With Dominic Solanke scoring six times this season and Kluivert – son of former Netherlands striker Patrick – notching his first goal for the club, Iraola saluted his side’s all-round offensive threat. “I think we have talent there, I think we have goals there, behind Dom. We were having the chances. They were not scoring the goals before and I think it is good for them confidence-wise to come here and to score in such an important game.” Bournemouth took the lead in the 12th minute when Antoine Semenyo cut in from the right and his ball into the box found Tavernier, who evaded his marker with a neat first touch before burying a shot under goalkeeper Wes Foderingham. Sheffield United then added to their own problems by gifting Bournemouth a second in first-half stoppage time. Foderingham was dispossessed on the edge of the box by Kluivert, who then steered the ball into an empty net and Paul Heckingbottom acknowledged his side’s performance levels had dropped. “Yeah, that’s been the topic of conversation in there,” the United manager said. “If we give goals away like that we’re not going to win games in this league, we know that. “We started poorly and never really recovered. We can’t hide behind mistakes, though, we need to play better than that and get it out of our heads before the next game.” The home side were booed off at the interval and fans vented their frustration again six minutes after the restart when Bournemouth added a third goal. Adam Smith clipped in an excellent cross from the right when left unopposed and Tavernier ghosted in at the far post to sidefoot home. James McAtee fired wide for the Blades following a goalmouth scramble but Bournemouth threatened to add to their tally. Foderingham kept out further efforts from Semenyo, Kluivert, Ryan Christie and substitute Luis Sinisterra while tempers flared in the 69th minute, with George Baldock, Jack Robinson and Bournemouth substitute Philip Billing all booked after a melee. McBurnie’s late header was scant consolation for United, who face bottom club Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday, and Heckingbottom added: “We’re going to have moments in this league, we are not stupid enough to know we will be at our best every week. “But we have to try. We have to quickly get this out of our heads for Burnley next week.”"
City,1,Liverpool,1,Trent Alexander-Arnold strikes to earn Liverpool vital point at Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/25/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-25,"Trent Alexander-Arnold did more than help to create a small piece of history and deny Manchester City a bigger one. When the Liverpool right- back hammered a lovely shot from distance past Ederson and into the far corner, he signalled his team’s readiness to go the distance in the Premier League title race. City had won every game here in 2023 – a run of 23 matches in all competitions. It is now over. One more victory and they would have equalled the record of an English top-flight club, set by Sunderland between 1890 and 1892. It was not to be. Erland Haaland scored their goal midway through the first half – of course he did. It meant he reached 50 in the Premier League from just 48 appearances, the fastest to the mark; Andy Cole had taken 65 games to get there. Haaland would almost pinch victory in the eighth and final minute of stoppage time, rising to meet a corner only to flick just wide and, in the end, it was a day when City let Liverpool off the hook. They were the better team, they created the bigger chances and the regrets belonged to them, not least when the referee, Chris Kavanagh, contentiously ruled that Manuel Akanji had fouled Alisson at a 68th-minute corner before Rúben Dias tapped home. It was a soft decision. Alexander-Arnold had said beforehand that Liverpool absolutely believed they could end City’s dominance and win the league. Now came the action to back it up. They were not at their swarming, marauding best and Jürgen Klopp would repeat his complaint about the 12.30pm kick-off after an international break. How was he supposed to prepare for the most difficult game of the season with one training session, he wanted to know. But his team found a way towards the end of a second half in which they had competed on a more equal footing, having got tighter to the sky blue shirts and the image of the afternoon was that of Alexander-Arnold shushing the City fans. He took a pass from Mohamed Salah to the right of goal and, with Bernardo Silva and Julián Álvarez slow to close down, he pulled the trigger in some style. Klopp would find himself ushering his striker Darwin Núñez away from the City manager, Pep Guardiola, at full time after the pair had clashed. It was nothing serious. More worrying for Klopp was the injury that forced Diogo Jota from the field and also the one Alisson felt at the very end. A feature of the early running had been Alisson’s discomfort on the ball. He dragged one clearance straight at Phil Foden and was fortunate the City winger shot straight at him. It was a mis-hit Alisson clearance that led to the City goal, the ball looping up and down on to Nathan Aké’s foot midway inside the Liverpool half, although there was still plenty for him to do. Aké did it, slaloming inside Alexander-Arnold and Dominik Szoboszlai before slipping a pass up to Haaland, who went into his muscle memory. One touch, then another, unload for the far corner. Alisson got a hand to it but he could only help it in. He beat the ground in frustration. He knew. City wanted to get at Alexander-Arnold through Jérémy Doku. It was clear from the first minute. With Akanji stepping into midfield from centre-half, Silva drifted towards the left, trying to create an overload to further examine the player who would finish as the Liverpool hero. It was certainly not easy for Alexander-Arnold in a defensive sense. Akanji was excellent, ditto Rodri while Silva showed off magical flicks and bursts. Some of City’s moves up and out from the back took the breath and they almost got a second goal before the interval. Álvarez, though, overcooked a cross for Haaland after a Doku break while Alisson snaked out a hand to push away a Foden shot. Klopp did not like Liverpool’s body language in the first half, when they were second best in too many areas. They did flicker, most obviously when Núñez directed a 15th-minute header goalwards from a Salah cross after an imperious run by Joël Matip. Ederson made a smart save. It was nearly but not quite throughout for Núñez. Szoboszlai also had a shot blocked by Dias in the 20th minute. The game could have been up for Liverpool when Doku blazed away from Alexis Mac Allister early in the second half to cut back for Álvarez; he lifted wastefully over. Or when Dias had the ball in the net after Alisson flapped at a corner. The pressure from Akanji was minimal but Kavanagh spared Alisson, ruling that it was enough to have put him off. Guardiola could be seen asking for more noise from the City support in the 70th minute – and not for the first time. The overall mood was soporific; maybe it was the early kick-off. Doku continued to bring the energy but City rather sleepwalked into the closing stages. Alexander-Arnold would provide the jolt."
Brentford,0,Arsenal,1,Kai Havertz springs to life and floors Brentford to send Arsenal top,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/25/brentford-arsenal-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-25,"Whatever happens to Arsenal this season, Mikel Arteta will know this victory courtesy of substitute Kai Havertz’s late header could be priceless. A lacklustre display against a committed Brentford in which Aaron Ramsdale endured a shaky return between the posts looked like ending in disappointment as the game ticked towards the final whistle. But after a testing start to his career in north London since joining from Chelsea in the summer, Havertz ghosted in at the far post to steer home Bukayo Saka’s cross in the 89th minute. The win means Arteta’s side go top for the first time this season and the manager dragged Havertz over to celebrate with the away fans at the final whistle after a testing evening that had frayed the nerves of his goalkeeper in particular. With David Raya ineligible to face his parent club, Ramsdale could consider himself fortunate that a first appearance since the start of September in the Premier League somehow ended with a clean sheet after he almost gifted Brentford the lead in the first half. But the spirit that Arteta has built in 200 games as Arsenal manager was illustrated when the rest of the team ran to embrace their goalkeeper at the final whistle. “He showed great courage,” the Arsenal manager said of Ramsdale. “It’s a joy as a manager to see this reaction. Encouraging each other and showing love to each other – it doesn’t get any better than that. Today is my 200th game and I cannot be prouder of the team.” Manchester City’s draw against Liverpool had given Arsenal even more incentive to get a result, although Brentford had not been beaten here since losing to Arteta’s side in the EFL Cup nearly two months ago and are always a dangerous proposition on home turf. Arsenal also welcomed back Gabriel Jesus and Martin Ødegaard to their starting lineup for the first time in five weeks but it was Ramsdale who caught the eye in the opening exchanges and not for positive reasons. He sliced a clearance that sailed out of play just before an attempt to take a goal-kick with Gabriel Magalhães that almost ended in disaster. Yoane Wissa was quick to close him down and Ramsdale seemed to panic as the Brentford forward came near. The ball dropped into the path of Bryan Mbeumo, whose shot was brilliantly blocked on the line by Declan Rice. Much to Ramsdale’s relief, Wissa stabbed the rebound wide. “You’re just a shit David Raya,” sang the Brentford supporters in mocking delight. With Ødegaard employed in a deeper midfield role alongside Rice, Leandro Trossard was tasked with supporting Jesus through the middle and the Belgian mistimed a header that sailed over the crossbar from a corner. Brentford – who had the Ukrainian teenager Yehor Yarmoliuk making his full debut in midfield – also struggled to find a way through other than a Christian Nørgaard effort that sailed off target. Arsenal have been linked with a move for Ivan Toney in January when the England striker returns from his gambling ban, although it appears unlikely that Brentford would allow him to leave, with Mbeumo and Wissa both expected to be off to the Africa Cup of Nations. But Trossard showed just the kind of goalscoring instinct Arsenal require when he reacted first to Mark Flekken’s save from a Jesus header from point-blank range to head home. Sadly for him, VAR adjudged him to have been marginally in front of the ball and the goal was chalked off. Arteta’s mood would not have improved when Gabriel Martinelli curled a cross straight out of play at the start of the second half. Things could have got even worse for the Arsenal manager when Wissa’s clever flick played Mbeumo in behind the absent Oleksandr Zinchenko but the Cameroon forward dragged his shot wide of the near post. Eddie Nketiah came close to making an instant impression off the bench when he went up for Martinelli’s cross but a fantastic headed clearance from Ben Mee cleared the danger. Flekken then almost handed Arsenal the breakthrough when he dallied on the ball under pressure from Saka but the goalkeeper managed to keep his cool. It needed a brilliant goalline clearance from Zinchenko to prevent Neal Maupay scoring late on after the substitute met Mbeumo’s cross. “We went toe-to-toe with Arsenal for the whole match,” reflected Thomas Frank. But there was still time for Havertz to enliven a dull second half when he was picked out by Saka to leave Flekken floundering and send Arsenal top."
Forest,2,Brighton,3,Brighton resist Nottingham Forest’s fightback after Lewis Dunk’s red card,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/25/nottingham-forest-brighton-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-25,"Roberto De Zerbi admitted Brighton reacted “like we had won the Champions League” as his players and staff ran across the pitch to celebrate with away supporters after a first win in seven Premier League matches despite Lewis Dunk’s red card. With two more players dropping down injured after Brighton went behind to Anthony Elanga’s early opener, few would have anticipated what followed. Evan Ferguson’s equaliser and João Pedro’s double enabled them to survive half an hour with 10 men to end Nottingham Forest’s long unbeaten home run. In a frenzied final half-hour – including the 10 added minutes – Forest pulled a goal back through Morgan Gibbs-White’s penalty, survived a potential red card for Murillo themselves but had Ryan Yates’s late point-blank header brilliantly saved by Bart Verbruggen. With 10 players injured and a crucial Europa League tie at AEK Athens on Thursday, Brighton could have folded here if it were not for “the character, the attitude, the spirit, the soul” to match their fluent football. Forest, now with one win in nine league games, threw everything at them before going down to their first home defeat in the Premier League since April. Brighton have scored and conceded in a record 17 straight Premier League matches. But few have been as dramatic as this. De Zerbi forgot to shake Steve Cooper’s hand as the emotion of the comeback understandably took over. “I want to explain my celebration,” the Brighton manager said. “It wasn’t disrespectful for the opponent. We are suffering a lot, losing 10 players to injury; we lost two [more] players in the first half; we lost two substitutions in the first half; we suffered a red card; we lost two points in the last game with Sheffield United, we lost two points against Fulham. “The last win in the Premier League for us was at the end of September. We are suffering a lot. It is one of the toughest moments, not just in the Premier League, but in my career and for me it was a big, big celebration. And for it we celebrate like final in Champions League or winning the Premier League.” Brighton’s inability to keep a clean sheet was extended inside three minutes. With the briefly returning Tariq Lamptey playing high and wide on the left, Gibbs-White could scarcely believe how much space he was granted going down the right wing before he delivered the perfect centre over Chris Wood and two defenders for the unmarked Elanga to head in at the far post. Brighton have made 53 changes to their starting Premier League XI, a division high, but they were forced into three more switches before the second half. Ansu Fati went down feeling his calf and he was replaced by Pedro while Lamptey had to be replaced by Jack Hinshelwood. Pedro’s arrival improved Brighton and they equalised within five minutes of his introduction. Pascal Gross passed into the feet of Ferguson who, dropping off Moussa Niakhaté, swerved the ball low into the bottom-right corner with his second. In the fourth minute of first-half added time, Pedro headed Brighton into the lead, gaining momentum with his run to beat Ola Aina to power home Gross’s cross. With Adam Lallana also withdrawn at half-time, Brighton could have been forgiven for feeling sorry for themselves. Instead, they went further ahead before the hour mark. Again Pedro was central: firstly he was pulled down by Wood; then he calmly converted the ensuing penalty, his ninth goal of the season in all competitions. How much the Europa League is affecting Brighton’s league form is a moot point. But while it is difficult to predict which way their games will go, no one can question the entertainment in them. The last 20-plus minutes of this match were chaos. Play went on for seven minutes before Anthony Taylor was called pitchside to agree that Hinshelwood had fouled Callum Hudson-Odoi. The debate that followed was so prolonged, there was time for Dunk to be booked then sent off for separate moments of dissent. Gibbs-White kept his cool to convert the penalty for his first goal of the season. In added time, Gibbs-White missed a free header before Yates’s effort was also repelled. But Cooper said he did not wish to hide behind the fact his team did not play well enough in the first half, even if he believed the penalty decisions “caused the animosity in the stadium”."
Luton,2,Palace,1,Jacob Brown strikes late to earn Luton vital victory over Crystal Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/25/luton-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-25,"Everton’s pain has been to Luton’s gain. There was still a desperate need to start winning and after a hard-fought lead had been surrendered in seconds, Rob Edwards, their manager, looked to the Bedfordshire skies in desolation. Teden Mengi’s goal had blown the roof off but the celebrations were barely finished when Michael Olise scored a brilliant equaliser. In his first start of the season, with a goal that was all his own work, Olise had franked his reputation as one of English football’s prime talents. “I felt flat,” admitted Edwards. But there was still plenty of time to locate a winner, for the outstanding Chiedozie Ogbene to find space to ping the ball in. Jacob Brown, a second-half substitute, slid across Joachim Anderson to score and snatch a first ever Premier League home win. “Delighted,” said Edwards. “Relieved, I feel drained, it was the longest game I have ever been part of that didn’t go to extra time.” After 12 minutes of time added on were seen out, Everton are no longer the sole team beaten by the Hatters since their top-flight return. Edwards left the field punching the air in unison with fans in the Oak Stand. This was the type of win his team have too often let slip during their three months in the Premier League. “It’s a mad feeling,” said Brown. A benevolent Roy Hodgson said: “Congratulations to Luton for holding on. For their spirited performance.” Palace, who have beaten only Burnley in two months and lost four from their last five league games, have an over-reliance on their speedy, skilful forwards. Hodgson’s team do not try to pass their way through their opposition. They looked incapable of doing so, especially after the loss of Eberechi Eze and Cheick Doucouré to injury. Moments of quality had been in limited supply in the first half until Eze’s shot was saved wonderfully well by the outstanding Thomas Kaminski, who immediately made an even better stop from Jeffrey Schlupp. That served to set home fires burning, fans and team alike galvanised. As half-time approached, Luton’s energy output was the greater but there was still thin gruel for Carlton Morris, their lone striker, to feed on. Meanwhile, Eze’s drifting, weaving runs and slick interchanges were causing them severe trouble. It wasn’t to last. Palace’s second half began with that double injury blow. Eze lasted barely seconds, limping off with a knock sustained before the break. Doucouré was tearfully carried off after crumpling to the floor with no opponent within touching distance. “Hopefully it’s not too serious,” lamented Joel Ward, Palace’s captain. “We gave ourselves an uphill battle.” “He’s damaged his ankle,” said Hodgson of Eze, sighing that Doucouré’s was a “bad injury”. Could Luton take advantage? Kenilworth Road gasped as Ogbene rose to head a cross wide before attacking reinforcements were sent on in the form of Tahith Chong and Jordan Clark, Andros Townsend taking his leave. Ogbene, down the left flank, forever in the vanguard, took the game to Palace though the Ireland international often suffered for a lack of company. Luton appeared to have paid the price of increased adventure when Odsonne Éduoard tapped the ball in the net at the second attempt only for VAR to reveal – correctly – the forward’s hand had played its part. Luton quickly profited; Alfie Doughty’s corner arrowed in, Ross Barkley’s run and leap caused havoc and the ball dropped to Mengi to control and score. The celebrations lasted seconds before Olise delivered his moment of brilliance. Edwards was aghast. His team had passed up the chance to swoop on beatable, visibly vulnerable opposition. It called for Ogbene and Brown to intervene and supply that golden, historic moment. “The players deserved a lot of credit,” said their manager. “They could have been very flat, it’s a beautiful counterattacking goal.” There was still time for Kaminski to make another save, with his foot, from Anderson as stoppages prolonged the agony. “Horrible,” said Edwards. “But the defenders stood up to it.” In the very last seconds, Kaminski had a post rattled from Jefferson Lerma’s header. The ball came back out and gasps of relief were soon followed by the raucous celebrations of a team giving themselves a fighting, credible chance of survival."
Newcastle,4,Chelsea,1,Gordon caps Newcastle’s rampant win as James red adds to Chelsea misery,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/25/newcastle-chelsea-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-25,"Long before the final whistle one thing was crystal clear; Newcastle’s players were prepared to jump through hoops of metaphorical fire for Eddie Howe. Despite being ravaged by a litany of injuries Howe’s team summoned up frankly awe-inducing reserves of energy to ultimately steamroller a hitherto supposedly renascent Chelsea into submission. What on earth does Newcastle’s manager feed his squad on? Admittedly Chelsea’s Reece James was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 73rd minute but, by then, the home team were so firmly in control that the recent talk of Mauricio Pochettino presiding over a serious challenge for Champions League qualification at Stamford Bridge seemed fanciful in the extreme. On this evidence defending remains very much a work in progress in west London. “It was our worst performance of the season,” said Pochettino. “We cannot complain. We didn’t read the game from the start. We lacked intensity and energy. I’m very angry and disappointed. I’m so upset. We were soft in every single challenge. We didn’t show we were competing for something important. We need more mental strength.” Newcastle’s injury crisis is so acute that Howe’s substitutes’ bench included three goalkeepers and a quartet of youngsters promoted from the under-21s. Given that 11 senior players are in the treatment room it rather begs the question is this simply sheer bad luck, the unaccustomed strain of juggling Champions League and domestic commitments or a sign that Newcastle’s ultra-high-intensity style is provoking systemic burnout? Maybe it’s an amalgam of all three but the parallels with the period when Marcelo Bielsa’s similarly high-octane Leeds hit a broadly comparable sort of wall cannot be ignored. Why, for instance, has Joe Willock broken down with achilles trouble so soon after returning from a lengthy absence spent nursing the same injury? After all, Newcastle cannot expect to play opponents as generous as Chelsea every week. At least Alexander Isak was back following a groin problem and marked his return by scoring a fine, 13th-minute goal. When a sublime pass from the excellent 17-year-old Lewis Miley unhinged Chelsea’s defence, the Sweden striker found himself played onside by Marc Cucurella and proceeded to take a classy steadying touch before swivelling and sweeping an unstoppable shot past Robert Sánchez. It did not take Raheem Sterling long to equalise. When Kieran Trippier felled Sterling just outside the area, the forward opted to take the ensuing free-kick himself and directed a gloriously dipping effort over the wall before watching it brush the underside of the bar en route to evading an utterly helpless Nick Pope. Sterling’s spirited, intelligent, gutsy, performance represented a rare positive for Pochettino. Undeterred, Newcastle refused to fold and, drawing on every last drop of adrenaline, attacked with typically, and exhilaratingly, aggressive ferocity at every opportunity. At times Chelsea seemed incapable of closing them down. Yet although an unmarked Joelinton headed narrowly wide and Trippier’s free-kick hit the bar, Howe looked mighty relieved when an errant Pope played the ball straight to Conor Gallagher. Only a rapid, sinew-stretching, intervention from the impressive Tino Livramento prevented a second Chelsea goal. Pochettino, exiled to the directors’ box as he served a touchline ban, cannot have enjoyed the way his players permitted themselves to be repeatedly bundled off the ball by their physically spikier hosts and could hardly have been surprised when Jamaal Lascelles scored Newcastle’s second goal No sooner had the unattended centre-half (where was Benoît Badiashile?) connected with Anthony Gordon’s cross and powered a header past Sánchez, than Joelinton extended the lead. This time it was Thiago Silva’s mistake. When the veteran defender made an awful hash of a back pass, Joelinton nipped in and intercepted before firing in Newcastle’s third. All that remained was for James, who had earlier clashed angrily with Howe’s assistant, Jason Tindall, to collect a second yellow card for fouling Gordon. And then for Gordon, outstanding throughout, to enjoy the final word, shooting low beyond Sánchez after meeting Miguel Almirón’s chipped through pass. “We don’t surrender,” said Howe before Tuesday’s trip to Paris Saint-Germain. “It was a real statement of character from deep within the squad. We didn’t allow ourselves any excuses.”"
Burnley,1,West Ham,2,Tomas Soucek steals points for West Ham and sends Burnley to new lows,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/25/burnley-west-ham-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-25,"When Vincent Kompany and Burnley won the Championship with 101 points and followed it with a summer of spending more than £90m on players, few in Lancashire could have anticipated the club having something in common with the 1970-71 Newport team of the Fourth Division, but after seven straight defeats at Turf Moor they have matched the Welsh club’s record for the worst home start to an English league season. Burnley’s appalling form continued with defeat to West Ham despite leading until the 86th minute, as a Dara O’Shea own goal and Tomas Soucek volley settled the match late on. Jay Rodriguez had scored from the spot to put the hosts ahead after Luca Koleosho was brought down in the box, some would argue for a second time, to give the fans hope of witnessing a first Turf Moor victory of the season. “It’s what makes this game beautiful but what also makes it hard. It is a tough one to take but it is still a universal recipe: you have to get up and keep going,” Kompany said. “I was looking at this game and come minute 86, the game is what it is, and you have to play until the end. At that point what I would have said is how outstanding the performance was on the ball, off the ball, disciplined, mature but as it is football is shaped – fairly – by the result and every minute of the game is as important as the first one.” Unsurprisingly, a match between the bottom club with the worst scoring record in the league and a side missing their top goalscorer, Jarrod Bowen – who has eight Premier League goals to his name – was short of attacking threat. Koleosho, Burnley’s shining light in an otherwise bleak season, made the most notable impact. The winger drove into the box and touched the ball past Vladimir Coufal before gladly accepting the outstretched leg of the full-back to trip over. The referee, Sam Barrott, pointed for a goal-kick and, despite clear contact, VAR did not overturn the decision after a check. Kompany said: “The message to the players is: ‘Nothing is going to be given,’ and if nothing is being given, you have to go grab the bull by the horns and not wait for people to make decisions for you. Margins make a big difference for us.” The teenager got his reward soon after the break when he went on a mazy run against icy defenders, who were unable to move at the same speed as they watched him slip past until he reached the box where Mohammed Kudus caught him on the foot. Even though the contact was far less obvious, the penalty stood and Rodriguez, 15 years Koleosho’s senior, fired it down the middle for his first goal of the season as Burnley collectively reached double figures. It was the third time Burnley had failed to hold a lead at home as their naivety was proven once more. The entire team dropped deeper immediately after the 49th-minute opener but held their own from then on, only to receive the sucker punch with fewer than five minutes on the clock when Kudus burst down the right and fired a cross towards Divin Mubama, but the ball went in via the unfortunate O’Shea. Kudus, the man who gave away the penalty, more than made amends for his earlier indiscretion with a second assist for Soucek as his cross found the midfielder in space at the back post to strike into an empty net for his fourth in four matches for club and country, silencing Turf Moor in the process. “The climax was great,” David Moyes said. “It shows a lot of the things we have got about this team: a bit of resilience, we stuck at it, never wilted, had to keep trying to find ways to get a goal and it didn’t look like we were going to. We probably didn’t play our best today, a lot of our players were nowhere near their levels but, ultimately, we got three points in the Premier League.” The good news for Kompany is that Newport won 10 of their final 21 games and were re‑elected to the Football League, although Bobby Ferguson was sacked after the seventh home defeat. The bad news is that Burnley are rock bottom with four points from 13 matches, giving few indications they are going to vacate 20th, and football is a meritocracy."
Brighton,1,Sheffield,1,‘I don’t like 80% of referees’ claims Roberto De Zerbi as Brighton are held,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/12/brighton-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-12,"Roberto De Zerbi said he does not like “80% of Premier League referees” after 10-man Brighton were held to a 1-1 draw with Sheffield United at the Amex Stadium. Simon Adingra had put the hosts ahead with an excellent solo run but the game changed on Mahmoud Dahoud’s 69th-minute red card. The midfielder stamped on Ben Osborn’s achilles, with Adam Webster scoring an own goal moments later to take United off the bottom of the table for the first time since 23 September. De Zerbi, who was booked for his touchline behaviour, did not disagree with the red card shown by the referee, John Brooks, but the Brighton manager said afterwards: “I am honest and clear, I don’t like 80% of English referees. That isn’t a new opinion. I don’t like them. I don’t like their behaviour on the pitch. “England is the only country where when there is VAR, you are not sure that the decision is right. In other countries, you have to be sure 100% that the decision taken is right. In England, no, and I am not able to understand.” Both teams have scored in all of Brighton’s past 16 matches, equalling Everton’s Premier League record, including 12 since the start of the campaign – last achieved in the top flight by Liverpool in 1966-67. De Zerbi is now on his longest run without a league win as Brighton manager, with his side having gone six games without taking three points. “We are spending time in an unlucky period,” the Italian said. “I think we have lost four points; two against Fulham and two today. There wasn’t a game until the red card. There was only one team on the pitch. Brighton could have won the game two- or three-nil, but after the red card the game changed. We lost order and our style.” Adingra went on a mazy run before finishing after a give-and-go with Facundo Buonanotte in the fifth minute. But after the red card, Jayden Bogle’s powerful cross was diverted into his own goal by Webster. It was the first time United had strung together two games without defeat in the top flight since July 2020. “Maybe getting off the bottom is important because people keep mentioning it but I’m not bothered. Not yet,” the visiting manager, Paul Heckingbottom, said. “What is pleasing is how we’ve played against a good team. It is always about the points. I can give lots of reasons why we haven’t picked up more points this season: the way we started the season, final moments in games where we could and should have.”"
Chelsea,4,City,4,Cole Palmer’s late Chelsea penalty halts Manchester City in eight-goal epic,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/12/chelsea-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-12,"So, Cole Palmer. How are your nerves? The question came in stoppage time, at the end of a breathless advert for the global pull of the Premier League. Manchester City led 4-3 but now the player that they sold to Chelsea in August stood over a penalty. Palmer had joined the City academy at the age of eight. He started the season with goals for them in the Community Shield and the European Super Cup. Now it fell to him to derail the momentum they had built over a five-game winning sequence; to fire Chelsea’s season some more, too, after the win at Tottenham last Monday. The wait seemed to stretch for an eternity. But when Palmer stepped up he made no mistake, scoring for a fourth time in Chelsea colours; each of them nerveless conversions from the spot. Pep Guardiola had said the really big clubs did not care to whom they sold. Had he tempted fate? Palmer was excellent here and so was another former City player, Raheem Sterling, who had scored for 2-1 at a point towards the end of the first half that came to feel like a lifetime ago. City thought they had nicked it when Rodri watched an 86th‑minute shot deflect savagely off Thiago Silva and fly into the opposite corner. Erling Haaland scored two more to make it 49 in 47 league appearances for City, Manuel Akanji got the other and it looked set to be a tale of heartbreak for Mauricio Pochettino and Chelsea. The manager was close to combusting on a number of occasions, driven to distraction by the decisions of the referee, Anthony Taylor – a perennial villain in these parts. Pochettino boiled over spectacularly upon the full-time whistle, feeling there had been a big foul on Sterling by the City substitute Mateo Kovacic moments before it. But, after Rúben Dias had dived in on another substitute, Armando Broja, to concede the last-gasp penalty, it was over to Palmer to put himself at the centre of the story. His goal celebration was muted, to say the least – in stark contrast to the mayhem breaking out around him. His insides churned. What a game it was, the touch paper lit midway through the first half by a penalty award for City that was controversial – and not only because the visitors had played on while Chelsea had three players down. First Conor Gallagher pulled up after hurting himself in the act of closing down Dias and then, after City went up to the other end, Reece James collided with Moisés Caicedo as they went for a high ball. There was no obvious clash of heads. When City pumped it back into the area, Haaland put his hands on Marc Cucurella, who responded in kind and watched the City striker go to ground. Taylor gave what had to be described as a soft spot-kick and Haaland converted with relish. Chelsea’s response bristled with personality. They had brought the intensity at the outset, moving the ball quickly and smartly. Now they went up another notch. James led by example, driving from right-back; Gallagher was a non-stop source of energy. City celebrated when Ederson tipped over a James free‑kick. But Chelsea had the last laugh when Gallagher sent over the corner and Silva timed his run in front of Haaland to glance a brilliant header inside the far post. Phil Foden shimmered with menace. He almost supplied Haaland with a cross after beating Cucurella and then, after stepping inside the same opponent, he blasted inches past the far post. It was Chelsea who scored next, Sterling tapping home at the far post, although he had the presence of mind not to celebrate in front of the City fans after running past them. Palmer started the move, trying to play in James, who watched the ball break off Josko Gvardiol’s foot before firing over a low first‑time cross. Back came City. Haaland was denied by a fine Robert Sánchez save after slicing on to a Julián Álvarez pass and Pochettino was incandescent when his team switched off on a City short corner in first-half stoppage time. Bernardo Silva’s delivery was wicked but who had tracked Akanji’s run? Nobody. There was no let-up from City at the start of the second half. Not from Foden. And certainly not from Haaland. City’s third goal had its origins by the corner flag on their defensive left and was fired when Haaland rolled away from Caicedo’s attempted interception in the centre of the field. Foden waited for Álvarez to overlap, which he did at pace and there was Haaland sliding in on the cross to bundle home. City looked ready to pile on the pain. Their counters were sharp and threatening, although Jérémy Doku did err with a dive inside the area for which he was booked. Chelsea revived, again. Palmer almost tricked through on the hour, beating three players but not Ederson and the next equaliser followed a spill by the City goalkeeper after Gallagher had unloaded. Nicolas Jackson took a touch on the rebound and guided into the net. Moments earlier, Ederson had needed lengthy treatment for a knock. Who could land the knockout? The home crowd howled when Kyle Walker got away with a handball on the edge of his own area and then some more when the substitute Malo Gusto lifted a gilt-edged chance high after Sterling had robbed Rodri. So to Rodri at the other end. And then to Palmer. With practically the last action, Walker had a chance from a free‑kick after Sterling had scythed through Foden. He blasted high. A City winner would have been too much."
Villa,3,Fulham,1,McGinn and Watkins dash Fulham hopes to keep Villa’s strong home form,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/12/aston-villa-fulham-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-12,"The rain teemed down for most people in B6 but all Aston Villa fans can see right now are clear blue skies. Unai Emery’s free-scoring team equalled the club’s postwar record of winning at home for the 13th league game in a row, matching the run set by the European Cup-winning team across two seasons in 1983. Even as Antonee Robinson inadvertently played a role in all four goals to leave Fulham two places above the relegation zone, Villa moved to within two points of second place in the Premier League. Robinson’s own goal plus efforts from John McGinn and Ollie Watkins took Villa to 29 goals scored – second only to Manchester City – and means they have won 22 games in this calendar year, equalling another club record, set in 1998. Next up at Villa Park? Only the Premier League champions, on a Wednesday night next month. Win that, and Villa will have equalled their all-time run of home victories from 1937. Not that Emery is getting too excited, not least as Villa have some other important games before then. “I don’t want to think a lot about what we did; but I don’t want to think a lot about what is coming,” the Villa manager said. “Really I want to enjoy each moment. I want to share with the players next week the analysis that we are doing. And then try to take full energy again and prepare for the match against Tottenham. Then we are playing here at home again against Legia Warsaw and City and Arsenal. “They are going to be amazing matches and very big challenges for everybody; so we are going to be very excited.” Fulham have been as meek on the road as Villa have been vibrant at home. Notwithstanding winning at Ipswich in the Carabao Cup, Marco Silva’s side have not won away in the league since the opening day of the season at Everton. So Villa could hardly have asked for more obliging opponents. Two goals ahead by the interval, there was an inevitability about proceedings as the Villa Park crowd took to its feet to applaud the team off at the break. “It was a frustrating afternoon for us,” Silva, the Fulham manager, said. “The first half we were poor on the ball. We didn’t exist on the ball in the first half. HT, we gave them belief, asked them to be more expressive on the ball. Felt we did that. The players fought until the end, much better in second half, but a game is 95 minutes at least.” VAR encouraged the referee, Simon Hooper, to rule out the penalty he had awarded for Timothy Castagne’s handball in the seventh minute but Villa were undeterred. Youri Tielemans, on his first Premier League start for Villa, made the opening goal, dispatched a superb left-footed cross that eluded Moussa Diaby and Bernd Leno but deflected in off Robinson. Matty Cash made a crucial last-ditch tackle to prevent Willian breaking clear on goal on a rare Fulham foray just before the second goal. It was a pivotal tackle. Robinson headed clear Lucas Digne’s lofted cross but only as far as McGinn who had time to take a touch away from João Palhinha before driving home his third goal in the past five games from the edge of the area with his favoured left foot. At least Fulham came out with their tails up after the break and Raúl Jiménez shot against a post, Willian sidefooting the rebound over as Villa sat back. The improvement from Fulham also played its part in Villa scoring the goal that killed the game, however. When Watkins headed clear Willian’s corner, there appeared no immediate threat as the ball fell to Robinson. The hapless full-back slipped, however, inviting Leon Bailey – just on as a substitute – to run half the length of the pitch and play the ball into the feet of McGinn. The Villa captain uses his bulky frame so well and stuck his backside out to act as a pivot, taking out two defenders to return the ball outside for Bailey to cross for Watkins to sidefoot in his 11th goal of the season. There was some consolation for Fulham as Jiménez rolled in his first Premier League goal in 34 games and 20 months, after Wilson played a diagonal pass over the Villa midfield for Robinson to square for the former Wolves striker. Carlos Vinícius had a goal disallowed for offside while Watkins covered his head with his shirt after nodding wide from four yards out after Palhinha had deflected McGinn’s cross against his own crossbar. But Villa were already home if not dry."
West Ham,3,Forest,2,Tomas Soucek strikes late as West Ham edge Nottingham Forest in thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/12/west-ham-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-12,"To establish Nottingham Forest as a Premier League club – and keep Steve Cooper, a manager beloved among its fans in situ – an improvement in away form is desperately required. A game lost from a winning position, albeit one held for just 43 seconds of play, was a severe blow to both objectives. Even though they knew precisely what was coming, Forest’s failure to deal with James Ward-Prowse’s expert delivery from corners and Tomas Soucek’s aerial prowess cost them the point to which they had been clinging since Jarrod Bowen’s headed equaliser. That, too, arrived via Ward-Prowse’s boot. One win from seven, just four points away from the City Ground, and 15th place with Bournemouth improving fast, spells imminent danger. “We’ve not done our jobs and been punished for it,” said Cooper, for whom Ward-Prowse’s “fantastic” delivery offered no excuses. “If you are not willing to stay with your man and head the ball then you are at the risk of conceding goals. I am really disappointed that we have not won, and it’s all our own fault.” While speculation over the widely admired Cooper may seem odd to outsiders, Evangelos Marinakis is an owner with his own, wilful mind, even if retaining the Welshman’s steady hand seems a worthy route to becoming the next Brighton or Brentford. Or indeed a West Ham, even if David Moyes’s team have lately been enjoying cup competitions and European expeditions rather than the Premier League. This was a first win in five league matches. Ward-Prowse received his manager’s compliments, gloved in criticism of his colleagues. “He is world class at his deliveries, if I was him I’d be disappointed that the other boys haven’t scored more headers,” Moyes said. Forest’s initial damage was self-inflicted rather than via Ward‑Prowse. As Cooper became only the second Forest manager, after Frank Clark, to make it to 50 Premier League games, his team were down by the third minute. Nicolás Domínguez, trying to pass upfield, succeeded only in hitting the rear end of his teammate Ibrahim Sangaré and Lucas Paquetá required no invitation to smash beyond Odysseas Vlachodimos. The Greek goalkeeper, impressive as a debutant the previous week, could not bail out Domínguez before Paqueta performed a celebration to recall the 1990s dance sensation the Lambada. Forest’s first-half response was admirable, their first big chance to pull level in the first half coming in the 12th minute, Alphonse Areola getting plenty of hang-time to claw away Taiwo Awoniyi’s header. Vladimir Coufal against Anthony Elanga, down the Hammers’ right flank, was becoming the key battle. Coufal’s early yellow made his afternoon’s work harder yet it was from the other flank that Forest’s equaliser bookended a first half of which they had slowly gained. Sangaré pinged Morgan Gibbs-White clear and Areola could only palm into the path of Awoniyi. After so many years of sterling service, Michail Antonio is being phased out as the leader of West Ham’s line. Bowen’s direct running is now the central foil for the twinned creative talents of Mohammed Kudus and Paquetá. Though with neither Paquetá nor Kudus much committed to pressing – Kudus providing zero protection to Coufal – such artistry comes at cost. “I don’t want us to lose that toughness,” Moyes said, characteristically doubtful of marrying verve with endeavour. Forest almost took the lead in slow‑motion fashion as the second half began. Elanga and Awoniyi combined, and home fans sighed with relief when the striker failed to hit the target. To take the lead, Ola Aina, pushing up from full-back, angled the ball to Elanga, who had again escaped Coufal. Yet Elanga’s lengthy, elaborate celebration was followed immediately by Bowen, performing an unlikely impression of Antonio, climbing to divert Ward-Prowse’s arrowing corner. “I can’t believe how easy the goals we have given away were,” Cooper said. For Bowen, that made it 11 goal involvements in 13 games, including nine goals. A bull-like physique honed in the potato fields of his native Herefordshire, as well as Ward‑Prowse’s nine assists and two goals in 15 games represent Moyes’s best hope of arresting his team’s slide from a decent start to the season. Antonio, old dependable, was thrown on in search of a winner from a Forest team that had begun to sag and look to the clock. All 11 Forest players were in their box as Ward‑Prowse repeatedly aimed for Antonio and Kurt Zouma but Soucek, just as dangerous, much improved after last season’s dip in form, would prove the matchwinner. First, he went headlong to produce a save from Vlachodimos, before Bowen forced another corner. This time, Vlachodimos, diving low, could not deny him. There was still time for Areola to save from Divock Origi but Forest’s away travails were soon confirmed as an ongoing, troubling concern. A better away performance than usual was cold comfort for Cooper. That “we have just thrown this away” was as much as he could offer."
Liverpool,3,Brentford,0,Liverpool up to second after Mohamed Salah’s double sees off Brentford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/12/liverpool-brentford-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-12,"Brentford came in search of a club‑record fourth consecutive Premier League win but faced the inescapable truth that it is Mohamed Salah who sets the records at Anfield. The Liverpool phenomenon maintained his prolific form by scoring for the sixth home league game in succession as Jürgen Klopp’s side moved up to second in the table, in the process heightening the significance of their next outing at Manchester City. Salah struck twice – the second his 200th goal in English football – before a fine finish from Diogo Jota sealed an ultimately impressive win for Liverpool. Brentford were obstinate and dangerous as they so often are under Thomas Frank, and the hosts required assured defending from Virgil van Dijk, Alisson and company to protect the margin of victory, but they were no match for the quality of Liverpool’s attack. “Off the top of my head he is the best player in the league,” the Brentford manager said of Salah. “What a level. He must be one of the best offensive players in the world. Not top 10, top three. When you have a player of that quality it’s good.” For Liverpool, that is. “Crazy,” was Klopp’s take on the Egypt international’s numbers. “A pretty special player.” Liverpool were stretched, and not only by Brentford’s potency on the counterattack. Injuries and a suspension for Alexis Mac Allister limited Klopp’s options to such an extent that his bench featured seven players aged 20 or under. The roll call of inexperience included Trey Nyoni, who would have been Liverpool’s youngest player in a league game had he appeared at the age of 16 years and 135 days. There was still recognisable quality throughout the starting lineup, however, and a centre forward in Darwin Núñez who relished the battle against Brentford’s powerful five-man defence. The Uruguay international was at the forefront of Liverpool attempts to break down a deep and well-drilled defensive line. He was denied twice in the opening stages by the Brentford keeper, Mark Flekken, when Liverpool’s fluency in the final third was amiss, and then had two goals disallowed in five minutes by a combination of an offside flag and VAR. Núñez’s first finish beyond Flekken was via the inside of a post after Dominik Szoboszlai scuffed a shot into his path. VAR confirmed the assistant referee’s original offside decision, but only after a lengthy check of a marginal call. The second was an overhead kick after Flekken had saved superbly from Van Dijk’s header, but Núñez clearly came from an offside position before converting Joël Matip’s follow-up header. Boos circulated around Anfield after VAR’s second review but it took the performance of Klopp’s bete noire in black, the referee Paul Tierney, to truly rile the home crowd. Chants against Tierney rolled from the Kop after he penalised and booked Matip for a foul on Christian Nørgaard, despite the defender first winning the ball. An ironic rendition of “We love you Tierney” followed when Liverpool were awarded a free-kick. The breakthrough arrived amid the referee-bashing. Núñez was heavily involved again, beautifully controlling Trent Alexander-Arnold’s pass to the edge of the Brentford area and playing an equally impressive ball into the path of Salah as he swept into the box ahead of Mads Roerslev. Salah steered a trademark finish into the far corner to create yet more history in a Liverpool shirt. He became the first Liverpool player to score in the opening six home league games of a season and only the fourth in total in the Premier League era, following Alan Shearer, Les Ferdinand and Thierry Henry. It also extended Salah’s run of scoring or assisting in Premier League home matches to 15 games, a sequence stretching back to January. Salah’s second, and 10th league goal of the season, was a routine header at the back post from a Kostas Tsimikas cross. But no one celebrated, suspecting the ball had gone out of play before Tsimikas delivered. Brentford players appealed as the ball floated across their area. Salah stood still as soon as his header found the inside of Flekken’s near post. Eventually VAR ruled the whole ball had not crossed the line and Liverpool could finally savour the moment. They had another to savour when Jota received Tsimikas’s pass on the edge of the Brentford area, cut across the substitute Frank Onyeka and crashed a superb shot beyond Flekken from 18 yards. The margin of Liverpool’s victory was convincing but the contest would have been much tighter with sharper finishing from Brentford and without the formidable presence of Alisson in the home goal. The Brazil international denied Bryan Mbeumo when the tireless striker was released through on goal by Roerslev, although it was a weak shot from the forward, and made fine saves from a Mathias Jensen free-kick plus an Ethan Pinnock header in the second half. “I know we lost 3-0 and Liverpool were close to their ‘A’ game but we had big moments and didn’t take them,” said Frank, who claimed Wataru Endo could have been sent off under current VAR interference for a foul on Nørgaard. “The big moments are unfortunately why we didn’t get anything from a good game.”"
Bournemouth,2,Newcastle,0,Dominic Solanke lifts Bournemouth with double to sink weary Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/11/bournemouth-newcastle-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-11,"There is a yellow wall in Bournemouth, but it is made of sandstone and lies beneath the row of pines that edge the cricket pitch just over the road from the car park. Having played in front of the Yellow Wall at Dortmund on Tuesday – capacity of stand: 25,000 – a process of recalibration is required for Newcastle to play at Dean Court – capacity of stadium: 11,379. That readjustment, as much as fatigue, is the problem presented by the Champions League. And it is becoming a problem: Newcastle have won only one of four games after European ties this season. That was, admittedly, the 8-0 win at Sheffield United, but at West Ham and at Wolves they were as flat as they were here. Seven points have been dropped in those three games. That doesn’t in any sense means that another Champions League qualification is impossible or even unlikely, but they do now lie behind Manchester United, for all their perpetual crisis. “We couldn’t be where we needed to be for it,” said Eddie Howe. “In and out of possession we were unrecognisable. They’re such honest players and they’ve given me so much that I’m absolutely clear I have to support them.” Newcastle have won just one of six away league games this season and that is clearly causing frustration among some travelling fans, one of whom became involved in a heated exchange with Kieran Trippier after the final whistle. “The fans are emotional,” the full- back said. “They have travelled a long way. I had a chat with one of them, saying we are giving everything and there’s no need to panic.” The physical demands are clearly taking their toll. Newcastle were without nine players due to injury, including Callum Wilson who has withdrawn from the England squad. With Bruno Guimarães suspended for an accumulation of yellow cards and Sandro Tonali banned for betting offences, two goalkeepers were named on the bench and there was a first Premier League start for the 17-year-old midfielder Lewis Miley. He played well enough and is clearly a player of immense promise, but this was, understandably, a disjointed Newcastle performance. Within half an hour, Miguel Almirón had been added to the casualty list after going down with a hamstring injury. He is one of 32 Premier League players currently unavailable because of hamstring issues, a spike that has been blamed on a combination of the stress placed in players by the modern fixture list combined with VAR and the way it gives games a stop-start rhythm. There has been a strange sense that, with the exception of the 3-0 defeat at Everton, Bournemouth had not played badly this season, despite starting the day in the relegation zone. In part, that is probably due to the fixture list – they are yet this season to play Sheffield United, Luton, Fulham, Nottingham Forest or Crystal Palace, all currently in the bottom half. Poor results that don’t match up to performances are probably preferable to poor results that do, but neither is a particularly good sign. At some point if results remain disappointing, confidence goes and then the jig really is up. But this was a good result to go with a good performance. They outran and outplayed Newcastle and, but for a series of fine saves from Nick Pope and some wayward finishing, would have won far more comfortably. It’s a victory that lifts them out of the relegation zone and, perhaps just as importantly, suggests there is substance to Andoni Iraola’s methods before this crucial stage of the season. Iraola described the performance as Bournemouth’s “most complete” of the season, although he admitted there was some anxiety at half-time that they had not managed to convert any of the four or five decent chances they had created. “We were doing well,” he said, “but we could not lose 1% because if we lost 1% they would start pressuring us. We wanted them to feel they would be under pressure, that it was not going to be an easy day for them.” Dominic Solanke got both goals to take his league tally for the season to six, matching his total for the whole of last season. He forced in the first on the hour after a Joe Willock challenge had fallen into his path, and then flicked in the second with his heel after Luis Sinisterra’s header had come back off the post."
Palace,2,Everton,3,Everton’s Idrissa Gueye stuns Crystal Palace in five-goal thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/11/crystal-palace-everton-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-11,"This was all supposed to be about the return of Crystal Palace’s dynamic duo but Everton clearly had not read the script. They had been pegged back twice after taking the lead thanks to goals from Vitaliy Mykolenko and the hugely impressive Abdoulaye Doucouré, with Eberechi Eze’s virtuoso performance including Palace’s first before Odsonne Édouard finally took one of several chances that fell his way. Even with Michael Olise making his first appearance of the season off the bench and the hosts sensing blood, it was Everton who maintained their recent superiority against Palace thanks to the substitute Idrissa Gueye’s winner four minutes from time. Palace’s dismal record against Everton stretches back to September 2014, having now managed one victory in 18 Premier League meetings since a second successive 3-2 victory at Goodison Park. Eze’s first start since the end of September in the week that the England midfielder committed his future until 2027 – and Olise’s presence in the match-day squad for the first time this season – provided home supporters with optimism there could be a different outcome this time. But having avoided relegation last season and endured a sticky start to this campaign, Everton have been putting things together of late and they made it four matches unbeaten in all competitions, with six wins in their past nine matches. “We are showing the belief that we can win these kinds of games and that is really pleasing,” said Sean Dyche. “It’s only the beginning, but we are changing the Everton story. “There’s a different feel to what people are writing about us and what they are saying and what the team is delivering. It can’t guarantee you wins, but it gives us a much better chance if you’ve got the mentality that we’ve been showing at the moment.” It took Mykolenko 60 seconds to give the visitors the lead after his shot had been blocked initially and the Palace defence made a hash of clearing the ball. That allowed Jack Harrison to pick out the unmarked left-back for a simple header. Selhurst Park seemed stunned. Eze, who was left out of the England squad this week as he continues his return from a hamstring injury, had other ideas and within three minutes Palace were level. His mesmerising dribble left several defenders for dead and was ended by a clumsy challenge from Jarrad Branthwaite. Sam Barrott – a 30-year-old taking charge of his fourth Premier League match – had no hesitation in pointing to the spot, with Eze calmly stroking the penalty past the Everton keeper, Jordan Pickford. The frenetic start showed no signs of slowing down as Palace piled on the pressure, Everton almost regained the lead when Dwight McNeil volleyed straight at Sam Johnstone. Eze was shown a yellow card for diving inside the area when he went down after a challenge from Branthwaite that, much to the Palace midfielder’s disappointment, VAR ruled there was not enough conclusive evidence to overturn. James Tarkowski appeared more comfortable marking Édouard and came to Everton’s rescue when the French striker dithered after being played through by Eze. Having been caught offside on numerous occasions, Édouard finally managed to test Pickford just before half-time but was unable to find a way past. Dyche brought on Gueye at the break to replace Amadou Onana and the Senegal midfielder was involved in the move that restored Everton’s lead four minutes into the second half. Mykolenko’s volley from the edge of the area came back off the post and Doucouré reacted quickest to stab the ball past Johnstone, with Jeffrey Schlupp playing him onside. Once more it was Eze who led the riposte, combining with Joel Ward before bursting into the box and forcing Pickford into a save at his near post. The introduction of Olise was greeted by one of the loudest cheers of the afternoon and he wasted no time in announcing himself with a shot from distance that deflected over the crossbar. Roy Hodgson was just about to put Édouard out of his misery by bringing on Jean-Philippe Mateta when Everton failed to clear and Lerma’s header caught Tarkowski napping, with the Palace striker gratefully gobbling up his fifth Premier League goal of the season. “I thought we did very well to come back from two cold showers at the start of each half,” said Hodgson. Palace’s hopes of snatching the win were dashed when Gueye played a one-two with Doucouré four minutes from time and poked past a despairing Johnstone to send the travelling supporters into raptures."
Arsenal,3,Burnley,1,Sleepy Arsenal awaken to overwhelm toothless Burnley with aerial prowess,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/11/arsenal-burnley-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-11,"Crisis averted. Or perhaps Arsenal were simply trying to keep themselves awake. While they briefly flirted with trouble after shipping a sloppy equaliser and even contrived to end a tepid game with 10 men, Mikel Arteta’s side returned to winning ways in the league after finding Burnley unable to handle nothing more fearsome than high balls into the box. With James Trafford flapping at corners and Burnley’s defenders even losing out in aerial duels with Bukayo Saka, it was rather sedate after last weekend’s rumble with Newcastle. Even Arteta, who raged at the officials after that defeat, could afford to be playful while discussing Fábio Vieira seeing red for a nasty foul on Josh Brownhill. “VAR was right,” Arsenal’s manager said with more than a hint of sarcasm. “The referee was right. Really positive from Mikel to speak about that. Good decision.” Arteta, who was without seven injured players, was happier analysing a win that moved his side level with Manchester City at the top of the table. Ignoring another bland showing from Kai Havertz, Arsenal could dwell on a selfless display by Leandro Trossard, their threat at set pieces and a refusal to panic after Burnley levelled through Brownhill. The frustration for Vincent Kompany was that Burnley, who remain 19th, were not blown away by scintillating passing. They could have built momentum after cancelling out Trossard’s opener but they remain far too callow at the back. Arsenal restored their lead when meek goalkeeping from Trafford allowed William Saliba to head in Trossard’s corner and the points were secure when another delivery from the Belgian ended with Oleksandr Zinchenko punishing more wretched defending. “The narrative on this game will be on set pieces,” Kompany said. “For us it is to see if we had moments and momentum. It was a very disciplined and mature performance. But the disappointment and timing of the goals will make us even sharper.” It took Arsenal a while to hit their stride against opponents whose spirit could not mask a lack of quality in both boxes. Arteta’s side were muted at first and it could have cost them in the eighth minute. Fortunately David Raya was alert, flying to his left to save Zeki Amdouni’s effort. Arsenal were sleepy. They missed Martin Ødegaard’s insistent passing, while Burnley succeeded in restricting Saka’s influence at first. Saka, who had been passed fit after limping off during the midweek win over Sevilla, could not get on the ball at first. Unimpressed with all the inoffensive passing, Saka unleashed some of his frustration when he tested Trafford with Arsenal’s first shot on target. Havertz, who was short of conviction again, looked pained after fluffing a decent headed chance. It is still not happening for the German, who later slowed a promising counterattack with a poor pass. Trossard got his shot away but Arsenal were not making it easy for themselves. They could have trailed after Johann Berg Gudmundsson pounced on Saliba’s error, only for Raya to make a fine save. Arsenal began to pin Burnley back. The pressure told when Saka nodded Zinchenko’s cross across goal and Trossard, playing as a false 9 with Gabriel Jesus missing and Eddie Nketiah on the bench, beat Trafford with a brave header. Burnley could only wonder how they had lost out in the air to two of the smallest players on the pitch. It was a weakness that Arsenal repeatedly looked to exploit, with Trafford strangely reluctant to come off his line and claim crosses. The ploy was so effective that it brought Arsenal another goal after Burnley’s equaliser. It was a simple way to avoid a drama. Arsenal had threatened to bring it on themselves by inviting Burnley on at the start of the second half. Luca Koleosho’s challenge on Takehiro Tomiyasu went unpunished after a VAR review and Brownhill’s shot went in off Gabriel Magalhães. Time for a meltdown? Not quite. Gabriel Martinelli immediately broke down the left and tested Trafford. From Trossard’s corner Trafford flapped and Saliba scored from a yard out. Arsenal would tighten their grip when another corner from Trossard led to Zinchenko guiding a measured shot past Trafford. Vieira’s late red card barely heightened the tension."
United,1,Luton,0,Manchester United ease pressure on Ten Hag as Lindelöf sees off Luton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/11/manchester-united-luton-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-11,"Erik ten Hag can breathe his latest sigh of relief as Manchester United head for the international break in good cheer. For this Victor Lindelöf should be thanked after a match-winner that ended a three-year wait since his last goal in club colours and lifts United up to 21 points, three behind fourth-placed Liverpool, who have played a game fewer. The goal came from a corner on the left. Bruno Fernandes took this, the move broke up, and the ball was worked by Mason Mount to Marcus Rashford on the opposite flank. He drilled a cross in and there was the Sweden defender to blaze beyond Thomas Kaminski. It came on 59 minutes and changed the mood from flat to joyful for the home congregation, who had been given scant cause for hope up to then. It sealed United’s fifth 1-0 victory in all competitions this season and was deserved. Luton arrived with the same plan that nearly undid Liverpool last Sunday as Rob Edwards instructed his players to keep compact and look to knock United over on the counter. There is always a puncher’s chance of this working but the prevailing narrative was of the numerous opportunities spurned by United. Chief culprits were Rasmus Højlund and Rashford, who wasted copious openings in the latest illustration of what is costing United this season: a lack of ruthlessness in front of goal. There is, too, a glaring need for flair, quicker speed of thought and passing, plus a lack of cohesion: all of which Ten Hag will argue can be better remedied when he has more players off the unavailable list – Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s illness making him the latest to join it. Twelve points and 20 league titles (in United’s favour) separated these sides but a straw poll ahead of kickoff failed to return any vote that said United would definitely win. This despite having to rewind to September 1991 for the last league meeting between the sides here when Sir Alex Ferguson’s XI won 5-0 and David Pleat’s team ended the season relegated. Harry Maguire, who now has a claim on being the first-choice centre-back, was, initially, a prime prompter of attacks, teasing the ball forward to Diogo Dalot, Alejandro Garnacho or, in what became a gilt-edge opening, Rashford. Maguire chipped along the right to Rashford, whose cross deflected off Gabe Osho perfectly for Højlund at close range. The Dane failed to break his league drought by aiming too close to Kaminski, whose reflexes saved Luton. Rashford has become the new target of those fans who have switched their ire from Maguire to berate a player who has scored one goal all season. A Fernandes diagonal that swept over the area could have been finished by a razor-sharp player rather than the Rashford suffering a confidence deficit. As the interval approached Christian Eriksen was forced off, Mount coming on. Now came the clearest chance yet: Højlund, dropping short, put Garnacho in behind with only Kaminski to beat but a heavy touch followed and Luton recovered. “You are embarrassing” was the travelling support’s send-off to United at the half-time whistle – harsh, but they had certainly been unconvincing. Mount attempted to alter this with a surge along the right that claimed a free-kick. Fernandes stood this up where Højlund would want but his header skidded wide of the right post. Runs from Sergio Reguilón and Garnacho were bright but there was no finish to get the scoreboard moving. Højlund joined Eriksen as the latest injury concerns with the manager unsure of the prognosis for either. Of the finishing issue, he said: “I don’t think it is particularly a confidence thing because Rasmus Højlund scored five goals in the Champions League and he came full of confidence into this game – it will come. “Rashford scored 30 goals last season. He’s not scoring now but there will come a day when he starts again.” Lindelöf’s intervention, then, was precious. And so, at the final whistle – after eight minutes of added time – United had two consecutive Premier League wins for the second time this season and Ten Hag wore a smile that not even a late booking for dissent, which made it a third for the season and a one-game ban, could remove. It could be translated, too, as relief that this stop-start season had got moving again. For how long, though, who knows."
Wolves,2,Spurs,1,Mario Lemina grabs dramatic win for Wolves as two late goals stun Spurs,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/11/wolves-tottenham-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-11,"Gary O’Neil held his emotions for a millisecond, glanced towards the fourth official, Thomas Bramall, and then let himself go, haring along the touchline, punching the air as he went. Given the season Wolves have had when it comes to VAR decisions, who could really blame him? This time he need not fret for nobody was going to tell him Mario Lemina’s winner, scored beyond the initial six minutes of second-half stoppage time, would not stand. All the while Ange Postecoglou, hands in the pockets of his blue woollen trenchcoat, quietly stewed. Wolves would have been forgiven for thinking they peaked moments earlier, when the substitute Pablo Sarabia – who entered on 87 minutes and set up Lemina for the winner with a deft pass – volleyed in after latching on to Matheus Cunha’s wedged pass. Sarabia’s strike was magical; he drove into the box and caught Cunha’s pass with a sumptuous first touch, juggling the ball off the instep of his right boot before dispatching a left-foot volley past Guglielmo Vicario at the near post with his next. That strike had Molineux purring but it was Lemina’s, which stemmed from a quick free-kick on halfway, that was the trigger for O’Neil to let loose à la José Mourinho. “I had loads of energy and couldn’t stand still,” he said. “I don’t know what happened, really. I had to run somewhere and we’re not allowed on the pitch so [running] down the side of the pitch was one of my last options.” For so long it seemed Tottenham would smuggle three points out of here and end a difficult week on a high. Without the injured James Maddison and Micky van de Ven, and the suspended pair of Cristian Romero and Destiny Udogie, this was arguably Postecoglou’s toughest assignment yet and until Sarabia struck in added time, it seemed one they would pass, even if not exactly with flying colours. They failed to tame a relentless and hungry Wolves side after Brennan Johnson’s first Spurs goal with two minutes and 11 seconds on the clock. Ordinarily, Wolves would have been staring down the barrel of a jarring defeat, with 17 attempts to Spurs’ six . Until Sarabia’s strike, both teams had only two on target. Wolves passed up several chances, the best falling to Hwang Hee-chan. Until a late effort by the substitute Giovani Lo Celso, Spurs’ only shot on José Sá’s goal ended up in the back of the Wolves net, Johnson beating Nélson Semedo at the back post to convert Pedro Porro’s low cross. Dejan Kulusevski’s nonchalant flick, to free the overlapping Porro, was the catalyst. O’Neil spent much of this game bouncing on the edge of his technical area in unbridled frustration. Hwang’s chance 10 minutes into the second half, which arrived after João Gomes’s shot pinballed towards him via a heavy deflection off Ben Davies, was golden from a Wolves perspective but there were others, too. O’Neil arched his back and looked to the skies after the busy Cunha ran into traffic and a few minutes later he sent a wayward shot wide after a neat give-and-go with the wing-back Rayan Aït-Nouri. At the end of the first half Spurs had to withstand a flurry of Wolves set pieces and towards the end of the second the 6ft 7in Wolves substitute Sasa Kalajdzic also sent a header off target. A foul on Pierre-Emile Højbjerg – one of those four changes from the defeat to Chelsea on Monday, when they finished with nine men – with three minutes of normal time to play provided Spurs some welcome respite. They carved out another chance when Lo Celso forced a save from Sá after Kulusevski chopped inside Craig Dawson, who was again outstanding in the Wolves defence. Spurs, presumably, thought they had done enough but there arrived another kind of spectacular capitulation. “I would have been very proud of the group even if somehow that game finished 1-0 to Tottenham,” O’Neil said. “It would have been a bit of a hard-luck story but I would have still been proud about what the group produced. It is probably the proudest I’ve been as a coach.”"
Spurs,1,Chelsea,4,Nicolas Jackson hat-trick leads Chelsea past nine-man Spurs in wild derby win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/06/tottenham-chelsea-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-06,"After everything that had gone before, it was only natural that there would be a degree of hesitation; doubts and questions. Was there something wrong with Nicolas Jackson’s goal that finally put Chelsea in front against nine-man Tottenham? We had already seen four goals ruled out by the officials, the video assistant particularly prominent – one for Spurs, three for Chelsea, even if one of those was overtaken by the award of a penalty from which Cole Palmer made it 1-1. Now we had to wonder whether Raheem Sterling had strayed offside before he crossed for Jackson. Or maybe there was something else amiss. Because it was that kind of night – when the game appeared to be played as much in front of the replay screens at Stockley Park as here in a stadium that teemed with emotion from start to finish. The occasion was underscored by Mauricio Pochettino’s return to Spurs as the Chelsea manager and it had been hard to escape the feeling that he would be the story. Instead, events would veer away from him and at breakneck speed. Pochettino was able to celebrate when Jackson’s goal for 2-1 was cleared by the VAR but there would be plenty of further twists before he could reflect on the first statement win of his Chelsea tenure. Or Ange Postecoglou could rake over his first Premier League defeat at Spurs. Spurs’s red cards were for Cristian Romero and Destiny Udogie while they also lost the influential Micky van de Ven and James Maddison to injuries. Yet they fought until the end, showing the personality that has characterised Postecoglou’s reign. It would earn them the gratitude of their fans, who rose to acclaim them and almost something more tangible. Eric Dier had come on as a substitute and he thought he had equalised on 78 minutes when he lashed home at the far post after a free-kick had found its way through to him. Cue another VAR intervention; Dier was deemed offside. There was more. Another substitute, Rodrigo Bentancur, blew a gilt-edged header from a Pedro Porro free-kick – Pochettino raged at the defensive looseness – and Son Heung-min ran through in the third minute of stoppage-time. He looked the favourite to finish. Instead, his shot lacked power and Robert Sánchez made the save. Chelsea would still have been kicking themselves had they failed to win. And, at the very last, they would embellish the scoreline with two more from Jackson. Spurs had nothing left at the back and the striker encountered minimal resistance as he finished off passes from Conor Gallagher and Palmer. At full-time, Pochettino strode onto the pitch and the snap that the photographers wanted came when he embraced Son in the centre circle. The boos that had been forecast for the Argentinian did not come. There had been applause for him from some supporters after his arrival on the touchline and now there was some more, together with hugs and kisses from Spurs staff members that he knew. Pochettino’s feelings had been different at the outset when Spurs tore through his midfield, bringing the tempo and incision. Postecoglou’s team might have had more from the early exchanges than Dejan Kulusevski’s effort that deflected in off Levi Colwill. They were flying and then, over the remainder of a wild first-half, they were brought thumping back to earth. By the time that the 12th and final minute of first-half stoppage time had been played, Spurs had lost their lead and Romero, Van de Ven and Maddison. They might have been two-up in the 13th minute, moments after Guglielmo Vicario had saved brilliantly from Jackson. It was Brennan Johnson who crossed low for Son to touch home only the Spurs captain had gone fractionally too early. The VAR lines snared him. Chelsea stabilised. Udogie avoided a red card in the 18th minute after he jumped in on Sterling with both feet off the ground; he collected only yellow because he missed making contact. Spurs would catch another break when Sterling finished only to be pulled back for handball but the game did then turn after a triple VAR check. Chelsea thought they had equalised when Moisés Caicedo threaded a low shot home from distance. Yet the ball had flicked in off Jackson, who was in an offside position. It was back to the first phase of the move and a penalty check for Van de Ven on Sterling. There was not enough in that. But there certainly was on the next phase and the next challenge before the Caicedo shot – Romero following through hard and dangerously on his Argentina teammate, Enzo Fernández. Off Romero went and in went the equaliser, even if Vicario might have saved Palmer’s penalty; he got his hands to it only to push it into the corner. Palmer and others in blue shushed the South Stand. What else before Gareth Bale appeared as the on-field interval guest? Jackson had the ball in the net on 38 minutes only for Sterling to be zapped for offside in the buildup; Postecoglou was booked after losing his cool with the officials and Reece James survived a VAR check for an elbow on Udogie. Postecoglou was forced to reorganise further in the 55th minute when Udogie stretched in on Sterling, getting none of the ball and all of his man. The manager went to 4-3-1, Dier and another substitute, Pierre-Emile Højbjerg, in central defence. Still he ordered a daringly high last line; Chelsea surely had to make a through ball count? Jackson fluffed a header from point-blank range while Vicario denied another substitute, Marc Cucurella, in a one-on-one. Chelsea certainly did it the hard way. To Pochettino’s relief, they did it."
Luton,1,Liverpool,1,Luis Díaz’s emotional late equaliser denies Luton victory against Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/05/luton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-05,"It may never be pretty but there is still so much to admire about Luton. Rob Edwards’s side looked as if they were heading for a seismic victory courtesy of the substitute Tahith Chong’s late goal until Luis Díaz came off the bench to steal the headlines and a point for Liverpool in injury time. Having stayed in it thanks to a brilliant performance from the goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski and the erratic nature of Darwin Núñez’s finishing, Luton’s players could be proud of their display against such illustrious opponents. But in the week that his father was kidnapped in Colombia, it had to be Díaz who came to Liverpool’s rescue with their 24th shot of the afternoon and he unveiled a T-shirt with the message “Libertad para Papa” (freedom for Dad) in celebration. His presence in the matchday squad had been a boost for Jürgen Klopp, who left it open to the Colombia international whether he felt right to take part after a week waiting anxiously for news about his father. A statement from his kidnappers, the National Liberation Army, in the early hours of Sunday morning confirmed that he would be released “as soon as possible”. Liverpool’s last visit to these parts was an FA Cup tie in 2008 that ended in a 1-1 draw, although Kevin Blackwell’s side were subsequently hammered 5-0 in the replay at Anfield. But despite picking up only their second point here following the draw with Wolves in September, this Luton side has been building in confidence and clearly relished coming so close to causing an upset in front of their passionate fans. “That could be the point that keeps us up,” one optimistic home fan insisted at the final whistle. As it stands they are exactly where they need to be in 17th spot, if only ahead of Bournemouth on goal difference. But this performance will strengthen the belief that Luton are not here just to make up the numbers. That much was underlined by the way they started, with an early effort from the former Everton midfielder Ross Barkley forcing Alisson into the first save of the game in a signal of their attacking intent. His opposite number Kaminski then denied Núñez from similar range in a frenetic opening period that set the tone for the whole match. Núñez was inches away from scoring with an audacious effort that clipped the angle of post and crossbar after he raced on to Trent Alexander-Arnold’s long pass. The Manchester City loanee, Issa Kaboré, should have done better when a cross from the lively Chiedozie Ogbene found him unmarked at the back post but the Luton wing‑back blazed well over. It needed another strong save from Kaminski to keep out Núñez again soon afterwards, before Mohamed Salah had his first sight of goal following a free‑kick but could not hit the target to the delight of the home fans. Luton’s disciplined defensive shape makes them a hard nut to crack and despite enjoying more than 80% of possession, Liverpool had to wait until 10 minutes before the break to summon up their best opportunity of the first half. A lovely touch from Ryan Gravenberch set up Diogo Jota on the edge of the box but once again Kaminski was equal to the shot. Barkley was next to try his luck at the other end but his effort lacked direction and smacked into the roof of the stand behind the goal where the travelling supporters were positioned. Ibrahima Konaté then inexplicably tried to trick his way past Carlton Morris and almost gifted him the ball, only for Marvelous Nakamba to earn a booking after sliding in on Alexis Mac Allister. Liverpool still have not beaten Luton here in the league since 1987, having now failed in their past five attempts. Mac Allister’s frustration boiled over and he was shown a yellow card at the start of the second half for bringing down Andros Townsend – a fifth booking of the season which rules the Argentina midfielder out of Brentford’s visit to Anfield next week. Alisson had to be alert when a powerful run down the left flank from Ogbene saw the Republic of Ireland forward hold off the challenge of Alexander‑Arnold and set up Morris, with the Liverpool goalkeeper just managing to divert his shot wide with his leg. Klopp had clearly seen enough and made a triple substitution, with Harvey Elliott immediately setting up Cody Gakpo but the Dutch midfielder could not direct his volley on target. Only Núñez will know how he then managed to miss the target from two yards out after being set up by a cushioned header from Salah that left Klopp with his head in his hands. The Liverpool manager was shown a yellow card for protesting when a VAR check against the Luton defender Teden Mengi did not result in a penalty. There was worse to come when Kaboré broke free down the right flank and picked out Chong to slide home and send the home supporters into raptures. But their celebrations proved to be short-lived when Díaz headed home from Elliot’s cross to secure a relieved Liverpool a share of the points."
Forest,2,Villa,0,Nottingham Forest beat Aston Villa after Aina’s early strike and Martínez’s howler,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/05/nottingham-forest-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-05,"There are home crowds who cheer goals less passionately than the Lower Bridgford Stand celebrated Neco Williams earning a goalkick when tackling Leon Bailey in stoppage time. But this summed up Nottingham Forest on a day they deservedly won for the first time in more than two months, denying Aston Villa a passageway into the top four of the Premier League. Goals early in each half, set up by Harry Toffolo for Ola Aina and for Orel Mangala, gave Forest the platform to halt Villa’s free-scoring start to the season after the West Midlands side had scored 26 times in their opening 10 top-flight games, their most prolific effort since 1931. With the Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, in attendance, the pressure could have been on Steve Cooper and his players. But how they responded, the customary but vociferously heartfelt chants of “Mull of Kintyre” and “Stevie Cooper” having barely subsided when they took the lead in the fifth minute, and the manager’s punches to the crowd were cheered from the rafters after the final whistle. For all the fact they had not won for six league games, which coincided with Villa’s unbeaten run over the same number of top-flight matches, Forest have still been loud and proud at the City Ground. They have lost only two of their past 20 top-flight home games, and the atmosphere remains as impassioned and feral as ever. “Today was a really good example of what we have become over the past couple of years,” Steve Cooper said. “Today was us – the supporters, the atmosphere, the ground, the players – at our finest. “You could tell before the game that everyone was up for it. Then the players, me and the staff will respond to that. We create a really difficult atmosphere for our opponents to play in but a great one for us to play in.” Before kick-off, both sets of players showed their support for Caiden Storry, the young bugler whose version of the Last Post, on the Sunday before Remembrance Day, finished a couple of bars early. But it was Forest who were soon celebrating. Villa have also enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with their home crowd in a year when only Manchester City have enjoyed better results. “I know to play at home for us is amazing,” Unai Emery said. “To play away, the opponent feels the same, and tries to connect with their supporters. When we conceded the first goal, they were increasing the emotional moment to take the energy.” Neat interplay down the left wing with Anthony Elanga culminated in Toffolo pulling his low cross back outside the penalty area. Aina arrived from right-back to crack a low shot into the bottom corner for his first Forest goal since arriving from Torino in the summer. It was also Forest’s first goal in the opening half for eight matches. Toffolo’s recall was one of several astute changes by Cooper. He shifted away from the five-man backline used in the 3-0 defeat at Liverpool, recalling Taiwo Awoniyi up front with Willy Boly the centre-back dropping out, and Odysseas Vlachodimos impressed on his debut in goal in place of the fragile Matt Turner. Content to concede possession while threatening on the counterattack against Villa’s remarkably high backline, Forest protected their new goalkeeper superbly. Apart from half chances for Nicolò Zaniolo, Moussa Diaby and Ollie Watkins, Villa had very little to show for their 74% control of the ball. Villa, so brilliant at home in their best 10-game start to a Premier League season in 25 years, had not learned from their hesitant start to the first half. It was two minutes into the second half when Toffolo pulled his cross back outside the penalty area; this time it was Mangala who let fly and, although Emiliano Martínez saved the shot, he misjudged its flight and the ball spun back over the goalline. “We are all human and can make a mistake,” Emery said, in the week Martínez won the Lev Yashin award for the world’s best goalkeeper after an unfortunate own goal against Luton. “It is not just the goalkeeper. I am never punishing the mistake of the players because I want to try to get confidence in everyone.” Villa’s slick interplay reflected that of an elite team, and Bailey’s introduction at the interval offered the threat of more width and pace, but with a two-goal lead and their home crowd behind them Forest were in a place they loved. Backs to the wall, nights creeping in, the prospect of an upset against a high-end team, their beloved manager under pressure, Forest dug their heels in and saw the game over the line."
Burnley,0,Palace,2,Crystal Palace’s win leaves struggling Burnley with unwanted record,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/04/burnley-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-04,"Vincent Kompany insisted Burnley were not getting the rewards their performances deserve after they slumped to a top-flight record sixth straight home defeat to start the season, losing 2-0 to Crystal Palace at Turf Moor. A mistake from Jordan Beyer allowed Jeffrey Schlupp to put Palace in front in the 22nd minute and, despite dominating the ball and having 16 shots to Palace’s four, Burnley could not find an equaliser before Tyrick Mitchell doubled the visitors’ lead in stoppage time. This defeat and Sheffield United’s victory against Wolves means Burnley are off the bottom of the table on goal difference alone, having already played a third of their home fixtures without reward. When they suffered relegation in 2021-22, Burnley lost eight home games all season, but could conceivably reach that number before Christmas this time around. “It’s tough because you want to call out the facts which is a mistake cost us but at the same time you don’t want players to lose their confidence,” Kompany said. “They’ve worked really hard in every game, today as well, worked really hard behind the scenes, they’re getting the performance for it but to get the rewards of winning you’re just going to have to stick at it.” Asked how worried he was about the home record, Kompany said his side’s problems extend beyond Turf Moor “When you have four points, it’s away and home form,” he said. “It’s not because we’ve got four points I can go and say we’ve got unbelievable away form. It’s tough. “Like I’ve told you even in the home games we can’t all of a sudden think that this is going to be an easy game but the performance was good, the result was not good. “I won’t deviate and take myself into anything other than making sure that we stay on plan, we stay ready to get the best out of our team.” Kompany side’s stormed to promotion last term, losing only once at Turf Moor and lighting up the Championship with their possession-based attacking play. To say that translating that into the Premier League has been difficult would be an understatement, but Kompany is full of belief that his side can turn things around. “It’s not in my style to get knocked off the ball,” he said. “You have to have an idea as a manager, whatever that idea is. Whoever says that style is the solution is a fool. “The solution is good coaching. The solution is better players – I’m not saying we need better players, it’s players getting better or having the best players. These are the foundation. “Some of those are sometimes solved by having good finances. They are the foundation of what decides results more than anything else.” The results may not be there for Burnley but Roy Hodgson was impressed by their performance and backed Kompany’s side to turn it around. “Burnley were good and we thought they would be,” the Crystal Palace manager said after a win lifted his side into the top half. “We’ve been watching them in our preparation and we weren’t surprised in the way they played, the quality of their play. “I thought they defended extremely well and prevented us from taking as much benefit from our winning of the ball as I would have liked to have seen us do, but the good thing is that even during that period we kept our shape, we kept working hard. “There aren’t going to be too many teams who get away from here with three points, I can tell you that now, not if Burnley keep playing the way they are playing. “We’ve got to be delighted with our discipline, our determination, our efforts really got us the three points. We’ll go back to London happy and I’m sure Burnley will feel very aggrieved they didn’t get more from their performance but if they keep playing like that they will.”"
Newcastle,1,Arsenal,0,Controversial Gordon strike gives Newcastle edge against Arsenal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/04/newcastle-arsenal-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-04,"The road has been heavily booby trapped, with hazards at almost every turn but, somehow, Newcastle have developed a knack of navigating a safe passage towards the sunlit uplands. No matter that Sandro Tonali, their £55m summer signing from Milan, is banned for 10 months for gambling offences or that a raft of senior players including Sven Botman and Alexander Isak are injured, Eddie Howe’s team continue to impress on all fronts. A controversial goal created by Joe Willock and scored by Anthony Gordon before surviving three VAR checks dented disappointing Arsenal’s title ambitions and suggested that a wonderfully resilient, currently sixth placed, Newcastle are here for the long haul. Granted it was gritty, and sometimes downright bad-tempered, but this was a statement victory capable of giving Mikel Arteta sleepless nights. Arsenal’s manager departed seemingly close to implosion and demanding “how the hell” such “an absolute disgrace” of a goal could be allowed to stand yet his complaints could not quite camouflage the reality that Arsenal were largely the architects of their first Premier League defeat of the season. Throughout a spiky, scrappy game of red cards that might have been – Kai Havertz and Bruno Guimarães were arguably lucky to avoid dismissal – an Arsenal side increasingly missing their injured captain Martin Ødegaard enjoyed the bulk of possession but were prevented from doing much with it. Instead Newcastle’s off-the-ball discipline repeatedly forced their guests to rush into playing the uncharacteristically long and high passes in the final third. It dictated that, ultimately all Arsenal’s territorial superiority counted for nothing. Even so, Howe’s players were a little flat until Havertz scythed through Sean Longstaff on the touchline adjacent to the home dugout. It was a rather high, borderline reckless, challenge but Havertz did appear to have been after the ball rather than the man and Stuart Attwell duly awarded a yellow card. That decision was endorsed by a subsequent VAR review but Longstaff, the otherwise excellent Fabian Schär and Gordon were so incensed that they, too, were booked. If there were a new category of orange cards punishable by, say, the miscreant spending 10 minutes off the pitch in a sin bin, that would arguably have been about the right sanction but, in the real world, a newly galvanised St James’ Park crowd chorused: “You’re not fit to referee.” All this edginess imbued Newcastle’s play with new-found adrenaline and Gordon missed a decent half-chance before the surfeit of emotion became too much for a volatile Guimarães who appeared to elbow Jorginho in the back of the head. A VAR review concluded there had been no offence but the Arsenal bench were not alone in detecting a potential red card. When the Brazil midfielder subsequently slammed the ball straight at Havertz before coming close to blows with Declan Rice he looked in real peril of spontaneous combustion. Alongside the impressive Longstaff and Joelinton, Guimarães generally played well amid a fierce midfield battle with Rice, but he needed to cultivate greater self control. Long before heavy rain began falling it had become abundantly clear that the onlooking Gareth Southgate was watching two teams harbouring precious little love for each other. As a former centre-half, England’s manager probably enjoyed Schär’s outstanding performance – how on earth is he not always an automatic starter for Switzerland – and must have been interested to see the England Under-21 right back Tino Livramento replace Dan Burn at the break when Kieran Trippier switched to left-back. Southgate will not merely have noted that Livramento did well against Gabriel Martinelli but that Willock ran on and, almost instantly, changed the narrative. As a shot from his fellow substitute, Jacob Murphy, seemed set to fly into the Gallowgate End, the former Arsenal midfielder somehow kept it in play before crossing for Joelinton, who challenged Gabriel and the loose ball fell to Gordon who applied the finishing touch from point-blank range. A triple VAR check ensued – had Willock allowed the ball to go out of play, did Joelinton foul Gabriel and was Gordon offside? – but, ultimately, the goal stood. As Howe jumped for joy, Arteta’s face turned as angry as the Tyneside sky."
City,6,Bournemouth,1,Manchester City’s Jérémy Doku sparks rout of sorry Bournemouth ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/04/manchester-city-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-04,"Jérémy Doku’s high-grade blend of speed, fearlessness and creativity was Manchester City’s headline act in this procession of a win. The opening goal and assists in four of the five others helped secure a fourth consecutive victory for the champions (in all competitions) in a display that is the latest evidence of their transfer market mastery. Pep Guardiola, who ended with Erling Haaland as an injury doubt, was delighted with Doku. “What surprised me the most is how clever he is when taking a decision, it’s really good,” the manager said. “He applies feedback immediately, he understands the game really well. I don’t want to change how he is, every game he has played he has played well, especially here at home.” On a rain-dotted afternoon in east Manchester the summer arrival showed why his manager preferred him to Jack Grealish on the left. The Belgian’s opener came on 30 minutes and key parts in the strikes of Bernardo Silva (twice), Manuel Akanji and Phil Foden on 33, 37, 64 and 83 minutes made it the Doku show. As a driven perfectionist Guardiola did not like seeing the second-half move that allowed Dominic Solanke to find the net, which was scrubbed out for offside (correctly), or how the same player later pinged the ball back off Ederson’s bar. By then Haaland had been removed at half-time as a precaution, as Julián Álvarez moved to centre-forward and Foden was introduced to operate as the No 10: his surge from deep, after a pass to Doku on the left, was finished by beating Andrei Radu at close-range when the winger returned the ball. Of Haaland, Guardiola said: “It’s a twist in the ankle, we didn’t want to take risks with him – he didn’t feel comfortable. He’ll be back maybe Tuesday [against Young Boys] but maybe next Sunday [at Chelsea]. Hopefully not a big issue.” In 13 meetings in the Premier League era Bournemouth had lost them all, their “best” result a 1-0 defeat four years ago. So anything but a City victory would be a major shock. After Guardiola eulogised about his players’ “hunger and desire” his XI went out and shredded Andoni Iraola’s. Haaland, Álvarez, Silva and the raw Doku were a front quartet who dizzied the visiting rearguard. Behind them Rodri was a purring presence as attacks were engineered the smartly precise City way. Doku is a classic Txiki Begiristain-Guardiola acquisition: a mid-market priced purchase at £55m identified by the sporting director, signed off by the manager and who, 13 games into his City career, has slotted in with ease. “Txiki made an incredible action to bring him here,” said the manager. Pace is a main weapon and after Nathan Aké tapped the ball to him along the left, Doku knifed inside and Chris Mepham had to do well to see him off. Haaland’s chief talent is the razor-sharp finishing and when Álvarez lifted the ball to the far post and the No 9 rose to head at Radu’s goal, only a flailing Lloyd Kelly thwarted the opener. It arrived a little later: Doku’s third goal in the champions’ colours was crafty because an increase of pace was followed by a layoff to Rodri, whose instant return was fired low and in. Doku’s next trick was to aid Silva. Wandering in from the left he passed to the Portuguese, spun right, received the return and proceeded to bamboozle Mepham before finding Silva again, who coolly finished. Doku’s man-of-the-match turn now featured in City’s third. Silva, again, fed him and, on teeing the ball on to his left with his right, he let fly, Akanji’s back diverting it in for the latter’s first league goal. After Luis Sinisterra padded in and beat Ederson for a Bournemouth consolation in the 74th minute, here, again, was Doku: this time a slicing 30-yard pass taken in Silva’s stride with aplomb before a shimmy and feathered lob sublimely defeated Radu for a fifth time. Aké, just ahead of the regulation 90 minutes, added City’s sixth via a diving header. Of the injury to Alex Scott, who went off just before half-time, Iraola said: “It’s the other knee [to which kept him out previously]. He felt it in the inside of the knee. Let’s hope it’s something minor but we can’t say too much before checking.”"
Brentford,3,West Ham,2,Nathan Collins seals thrilling comeback for Brentford against West Ham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/04/brentford-west-ham-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-04,"It would not have felt right if Neal Maupay’s first goal in 35 appearances had not come in a Brentford win. After all, it is what they do against West Ham, whose third consecutive league defeat was not only because of their wastefulness when they were dominating the first half. If David Moyes found himself struggling to understand how a performance featuring a stunning goal from Mohammed Kudus had not yielded a reward, he only had to look at his team ceding the initiative during yet another flat second half. It is not enough to point at Michail Antonio failing to convert an open goal when West Ham led 2-1. One miss does not excuse this collective failure. It was the latest example of West Ham floundering after sitting on a lead. They were unambitious, their threat on the counterattack nonexistent, but it was a misguided plan. It could not work with Kurt Zouma absent in defence and the suspended Edson Álvarez unable to provide security in defensive midfield. Brentford, who took ninth place from Moyes’s side with their third straight win, took advantage. Mathias Jensen was outstanding in midfield. Bryan Mbeumo was a constant menace and Brentford soared thanks to their aerial power, equalising through Konstantinos Mavropanos’s own goal before Nathan Collins headed in his first goal for the club. “Every win in the Premier League feels fantastic,” Thomas Frank said. “A good performance makes me a happy man. I love my team. Second half we didn’t look back.” The opening period was more of a struggle for Brentford, so it was a surprise when they went ahead. Mind you, something about facing West Ham seems to turn Maupay into Erling Haaland. The striker’s previous goal had come against them and Brentford sensed it would be their day when he nodded home after 11 minutes. Moyes fumed at the defending, with West Ham sliced apart on the right. Yoane Wissa shot, Vladimir Coufal blocked and Tomas Soucek’s clearance dropped to Frank Onyeka, whose wayward effort was diverted past Alphonse Areola by Maupay. West Ham’s response was strong. They were without Lucas Paquetá, so often their creative hub, and Moyes adapted. The visitors were dangerous with Jarrod Bowen joining Antonio up front. Brentford were uncomfortable. Antonio made the equaliser with a cross from the left. Kudus, contorting his body, sent an acrobatic volley beyond Mark Flekken. Kudus came alive after his goal, repeatedly evading Vitaly Janelt, filling in at left-back with Aaron Hickey and Rico Henry absent. West Ham believed and Brentford were pierced when Saïd Benrahma crossed from the left. Kudus hit the woodwork but Bowen gobbled up the rebound for his seventh goal of the season. The goal survived a VAR check for handball and West Ham should have led 3-1 when Kudus and Bowen combined again, only for Antonio to shoot wide when Benrahma seemed better placed. Given hope, Brentford immediately threatened, Mbeumo firing two efforts just wide. “Half-time was big for us,” said Moyes, whose side have dropped into the bottom half. “Coming out it was really important we got the third goal. If we’d have been defensively strong we’d have got opportunities. We didn’t stop Brentford getting momentum. They keep you under pressure. We’re not talking about anything weird and wonderful. If I’d been a player I’d have been disgusted with myself.” West Ham wilted. Emerson Palmieri, who received no protection from Benrahma, was vulnerable at left-back. In midfield Soucek and James Ward-Prowse were not close enough to Jensen as he threaded clever balls into the attack. Moyes highlighted a lack of concentration as he explained his side’s repeated habit of conceding shortly after half-time. Nayef Aguerd needlessly conceded a corner and West Ham failed to switch on when Brentford took it short. Mbeumo produced a vicious cross, Areola stayed on his line and Mavropanos headed into his own net. West Ham’s earlier zest was gone. Maupay had a shot blocked and Jensen tightened his grip. With 69 minutes gone, the Dane moved right and whipped in a beautiful cross. Nobody challenged Collins as he sent a firm header past Areola. Brentford, unbeaten in 14 London derbies, deserved their second home win of the season. They keep overwhelming West Ham."
Sheffield,2,Wolves,1,Last-gasp Oliver Norwood penalty earns Sheffield United first win of the season ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/04/sheffield-united-wolves-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-04,"For 10 games this season, talk of the P-word was banned around Bramall Lane. Points. Who wanted to predict how many Sheffield United would get? The D-word was not mentioned much either; Derby County, and their infamous record-low points tally of 11. Nobody wants to stoop lower than the Rams of 2007-08. The Blades have finally cut through that “noise”, as Paul Heckingbottom described it, after a win that owed as much to fortune as it did the hosts’ fighting spirit. Thank goodness, for them, that James McAtee’s pass ricocheted off Toti Gomes to drop into Cameron Archer’s path for the opener. Thank goodness for Fábio Silva’s foolishness, bundling into George Baldock deep into stoppage-time to concede a penalty. Thank goodness VAR opted not to intervene. There was nothing lucky about Norwood’s spot-kick, thundered home in the 100th minute with the passion of a captain whose ship appeared to be sinking. It crashed in via the underside of the crossbar and then Norwood took flight, towards the jubilant crowd in the Kop Stand behind the goal to celebrate. Norwood said the United players would remain “100 %” behind the under-fire Heckingbottom. Platitudes are fine, but points count more than promises. Nothing could have served his manager better than his sweetly struck winner. They played the Great Escape theme music as supporters left the stadium, perhaps another indication of the optimism now coursing through the veins of the red half of Sheffield. They were staring down the barrel when Jean-Ricner Bellegarde levelled on 89 minutes. It looked as if Archer’s pinpoint strike would earn them a meagre point. Wolves had been good value for the draw, but they lacked impetus until the arrival of Bellegarde from the substitutes’ bench on 61 minutes. First half chances had been squandered by Hwang Hee-chan and Sasa Kalajdzic; United looked understandably nervous but the visitors failed to take advantage. Heckingbottom was adamant his players got everything they deserved. “It was a big performance and a big three points,” he said. “It’s not a walk in the park in this league but you can’t panic. It’s nice to win after a dominant performance.” There has been some mitigation for Heckingbottom in the face of his critics considering United haven’t yet faced any of their fellow bottom four sides. Games against Burnley, Bournemouth and Luton await before 2023 is out; they will be crucial. Heckingbottom also had nine players in the physio’s room for this game, though he was able to welcome back defensive stalwart Baldock after a calf injury. The right-back’s experience was telling, smartly winning the penalty after Bellegarde’s equaliser had taken an unlucky deflection off him 10 minutes earlier. “George relishes these games, definitely,” said Heckingbottom, whose side are still bottom. Gary O’Neil was furious with what he dubbed a “crazy” penalty call from Rob Jones, which VAR did not overturn despite a lengthy review, with the referee standing by his decision after a heated conversation with O’Neil in the officials’ room after the game. “It’s not a penalty,” said the Wolves manager. “Hardly any contact. It’s a tough one to discuss, really, it’s another terrible decision, I don’t understand why he feels the need to give it. “The only contact I can see is maybe Fábio’s shinpad with Baldock’s calf but it’s a graze. Baldock’s already on his way down. If you give a foul for that much contact, there’d be one million fouls in the 90 minutes. Craziness.” O’Neil conceded that Wolves had missed Pedro Neto, out with a hamstring injury, and wasted key chances. But he may also rue the role of Silva who missed a header to win the game in stoppage-time before bundling Baldock over to cap a miserable cameo, which left the 21-year-old substitute in tears at full-time. “He was obviously very upset as he feels he’s cost the team, but he has my full support,” said O’Neil. “That defeat today is on me and the whole group, not on Fábio. We need to be better.”"
Everton,1,Brighton,1,Late Ashley Young own goal floors Everton to gift Brighton draw,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/04/everton-brighton-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-04,"It was a rarity when Brighton were without the ball, so it was surprising it took them until the 84th minute to equalise and even more so given they needed an Everton defender to score the goal. It was a clash of styles at Goodison Park as Sean Dyche’s banks of four watched Roberto De Zerbi’s Brighton enjoy 80% possession. Everton have come a long way under Dyche and will feel they should have held on, only to see Ashley Young divert Kaoru Mitoma’s cross over Jordan Pickford to cancel out Vitalii Mykolenko’s seventh-minute opener. “It is definitely a point gained – they are a good outfit,” Dyche said. “The players are adapting to most of the challenges that are coming their way. Evertonians are seeing a team that is putting everything into a game and I think they saw that today. These are building blocks, we are not the real deal yet, with what we are looking for with consistency and mentality. The mentality was excellent today.” Brighton’s approach often results in players popping up in unexpected places but on this occasion it was Everton who pulled a trick out of the hat. Dwight McNeil collected the ball on the left flank before drilling a low cross into Mykolenko at the near post, the full-back took a touch and fired at Bart Verbruggen. The goalkeeper reacted by parrying with his right hand but the ball went straight back to the Ukrainian to fire into the roof of the net via a Lewis Dunk thigh, leaving them a mere 83 minutes to keep Brighton at bay. Dunk had the final touch on a potential goal at the other end but with greater intention and venom than his involvement in the first. A free-kick was lifted to the back post by Pascal Gross to the England defender who showed the technical ability that the modern centre-back requires by sending a powerful, side-footed volley into the top corner beyond Pickford. Then, however, VAR intervened and the minutes passed as Michael Oliver’s lines adjudged the goal should be ruled out for offside leaving the Everton fans celebrating for a second time. Dyche’s Everton resemble what he built at Burnley in terms of shape and style, which helped stymie Brighton. He has brought discipline to a side that lacked it under Frank Lampard, who endured a 4-1 defeat to Brighton at home in January and was soon shown the door. Ten months on and they can no longer be accused of leaking goals, which will make it all the more frustrating that they could not hold on against Brighton. The return of Dominic Calvert-Lewin has been a boost to Dyche, bringing a much-needed threat in the final third and helping Dyche’s side play on the counter because he can hold the ball up and chase direct passes over the top. The striker caused problems for the Brighton centre-backs and Dyche told the referee he should have earned a penalty after grappling with Jan Paul van Hecke in the box in the 81st minute, but complaints were waved away and VAR did not see fit to change referee Tim Robinson’s mind. One element holding back Dyche’s plan to sit deep and absorb pressure is the lack of viable options on the bench. When an opponent has the ball for more than three-quarters of the match, it is mentally and physically draining for a team but Dyche’s only changes came after the equaliser when he made a double substitution in the 90th minute. Brighton looked the fresher side going into the final stages of the match and Everton were made to pay for their fatigue. The result leaves Brighton winless in five Premier League matches. They are lacking the tempo and creativity they have shown at their best under De Zerbi but they merited an equaliser. It came from the left, as did most of their attacks, when Mitoma found some space and the unfortunate Young could only send the ball into his own net. “It’s an important point, we are not playing well like one or two months ago but there are reasons for it,” De Zerbi said. “We are fighting, I think we played a good game. We didn’t shoot enough to win the game and I think the result is fair."
Fulham,0,United,1,Fernandes’s late strike gives Manchester United timely win at Fulham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/04/fulham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-11-04,"Even a clown car sometimes runs in a straight line. Fulham were marginally the better side here, had more of the shots and more of the creativity in the final third, won more of the big challenges, played with more confidence and courage. All of which they contrived to undo in about 15 seconds of pure catastrophe in the final minute of the game, a routine clearing of the lines that they somehow managed to turn into a kind of anarchic performance art. And through it all, lurking on the edge of things, waiting for his moment, was Bruno Fernandes. Through the years of pain and punishment, the indignities and the disgraces, the aimless days and the listless nights, Bruno has always been there. Bruno, with his outrageous talent and his talent for outrage. Bruno, the lightning rod of rage and the heart of dysfunction, the storm and the man who can calm the storm. And admittedly, the man who can occasionally jog around for 90 minutes pretending the storm is none of his business. Bruno was always there, even if sometimes it didn’t feel like it made much of a difference, even if there were people who didn’t want him to be. For all his faults he has long been the restless, festering energy at the heart of this wretched football club: not something perfect, but something real. This was his third goal of the season, and all three have been winners. And here it was, his curling shot in the 91st minute that settled a game that frankly had every right to remain scoreless. Of course, he did not win this game on his own. Facundo Pellistri transformed United’s right flank when he came on as substitute for Antony. Diogo Dalot made a crucial interception in the first half and André Onana made two big saves in the second. Aaron Wan-Bissaka remains unrivalled at clearing up the dangerous situations created by Aaron Wan-Bissaka. But ultimately this was Bruno’s hour: the game’s unreliable narrator, its Rosebud, the man capable of taking a long boring trip back up the M6 and turning it into a thrashing festival of song. As for Fulham, this was a game they would probably have won with a decent striker. Rodrigo Muniz made his first league start of the season here, went off in tears after suffering yet another injury, and so the great gaping hole where Aleksandar Mitrovic once stood remains unfilled. Harry Wilson and João Palhinha had good chances, Willian shuffled and scuttled around, Alex Iwobi had a storming game in midfield, but ultimately it came down to killer instinct. Fulham still don’t have it. United, for all the things have forgotten, still just about have theirs. They might have been ahead early on, but Scott McTominay’s goal was ruled out for offside against Harry Maguire, who lunged at the ball without making contact. Was Maguire affecting play? Is Maguire ever really affecting play? After several minutes of existential contemplation, John Brooks chalked off the goal. And to be fair to Maguire he had a pretty good game, not just as a gripping and grappling presence at the back but also – more worryingly – as one of United’s main sources of creativity. “Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack,” chanted the United fans. So Maguire would pump a long missile up to Rasmus Højlund and Fernandes would try to pick up the second ball. It was, at least, a plan. Meanwhile Wilson was having a superb game on the Fulham right. Højlund and Tim Ream were having a duel straight out of the Marvel Comic Universe. Palhinha – a £15m player surely worth £100m by now – was the best midfielder on the pitch by an embarrassingly wide margin. Antony – a £100m player surely worth £15m now – was just sort of existing. But as the missed chances began to pile up, you could sense a certain tension in Fulham, a presage of the very fate they were trying to avoid. As Antonee Robinson played the ball back towards his own goal Pellistri sensed it too, charging down Palhinha and forcing a rushed clearance that hit Ream, and then another that dribbled straight to Fernandes. Fernandes got the ball back from Pellistri, shuffled the ball on to his right foot and picked his spot. It doesn’t make everything better again. It doesn’t make United good. But when the wider war is being calamitously lost, you have to take your little victories when you can. A final word to the Fulham fans, who devised pretty much the politest protest ever seen at a Premier League ground, even if it sprang from a deep well of resentment. A sea of yellow cards appeared around the ground in the 18th minute, as supporters expressed their disgust at the 18% rise in season ticket prices that is Shahid and Tony Khan’s latest attempt to turn Craven Cottage into the exclusive playground of the rich. United may have picked their pockets yesterday. But their own club has arguably been pulling off the same trick for years."
United,0,City,3,Haaland doubles up as Manchester City humiliate neighbours United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/29/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-29,"“Mind the gap”; “Old Trafford is falling down”; and “we’ve got Guardiola”: what a day for Manchester City fans, who delighted in these choruses as their team swatted aside a Manchester United side that was devoid of ideas. Erik ten Hag’s side failed miserably to give Sir Bobby Charlton what the great man would have craved: a victory. Or, even, a performance because they lacked any consistent creative plan and faced an opponent who possesses one. For a while in the first half this derby had a throwback feel as United and City scuffled for ascendancy. Then, the champions turned the screw and blew away a United who ended seriously embarrassed. When Phil Foden tapped Erling Haaland’s unselfish ball over André Onana’s line it had swathes of home fans departing, and the manner of the strike summed up the state of their team. This City third was presaged by Rodri being allowed by an uninterested Christian Eriksen to pad forward and shoot – when Onana saved there was the Norwegian to set up Foden. Haaland began with nine Premier League goals and ended with 11. The 10th came before the break and from the spot: a hapless Rasmus Højlund yanked down Rodri and the 6ft 4in striker sent Onana the wrong way. His second came after the change of ends – from a dipping Bernardo Silva cross, as the United rearguard was sucked right to leave Haaland unmarked to finish. The blame for United’s disarray has to lay with Ten Hag, who after 17 months and three transfer windows has constructed a side with scant apparent gameplan and too many low-grade players. The defence the manager sent out here acts as an emblem of his thinking. When United fans read the names of Victor Lindelöf, Harry Maguire, Jonny Evans and Diogo Dalot any hope they harboured surely faded – especially as Ten Hag declared that Raphaël Varane was out for a “tactical” reason. This baffled given that Lindelöf, Maguire and Evans are second-choice defenders and Evans is 35. Haaland’s second goal illuminated the manager’s folly because Lindelöf, his nominated left-back, lost the lurking striker and left him with a free header. Ten Hag’s explanation was a puzzle. “When you face City, they will go up to press and so to play with Rafa [Varane on the right] and Maguire on the left – that can give problems and then you end up kicking long balls. He is better on the right, Harry, especially against teams pressing high and then you have to step in on the left, especially against [Julián] Álvarez.” Sergio Reguilón is a career left-back yet he, too, was on the bench before replacing Lindelöf on 73 minutes when United were 2-0 down: a classic case of the gate being jammed shut after the horse has disappeared over the horizon. City deserve copious credit for knocking United to the canvas and keeping them there. Guardiola’s side was filled with high-grade performers: John Stones, Jack Grealish, Silva, Foden, Haaland, Rodri and Álvarez deserve a special mention. Their ascendancy came after United, for a flash, were a picture of slick possession and movement. Then, City’s attack play took over. Rodri floated a pass over the sleeping Lindelöf for Kyle Walker to turn back in, Foden headed at goal, Onana stuck out a hand, then did the same to deny a lurking Haaland by millimetres and United breathed again. Ten Hag contended the first half was “toe-to-toe” but this was about it for United. From here City exerted a chokehold, knocking the ball between them, Grealish a reliable outlet. So when Onana, twice, sliced a long ball straight to a blue shirt Ten Hag’s exasperation was comprehensible. Obviously discontented, the Dutchman refused to comment about the penalty Paul Tierney awarded after viewing the pitchside monitor on the instruction of the VAR, Michael Oliver. At a free-kick floated in on a diagonal from the right Højlund gripped Rodri, who went down in the area. After Tierney’s decision – it appeared correct –Haaland rolled the ball to Onana’s left and City were ahead. Before the kick Guardiola had a long chat with Stones and Walker. What he would not have instructed was for Foden to make a backpass that was a perfect through ball for Højlund, who burned in chasing instant redemption before he was forced wide and the hope died. After the break came City’s second-half show which a flailing United could not stop and, so, for this observer there is no doubt: Ten Hag’s team are going backwards from the edition that finished third and claimed the Carabao Cup last season. By the close those with blue blood inside Old Trafford had another chant to torment their opposite number with, saying United’s fans were watching the champions and would then clear off home. Many had left by then and you could not blame them. Before kick-off the Stretford End held up a banner about Charlton that said: “The finest English footballer the world has ever seen”. How United could have done with his supreme talent."
Liverpool,3,Forest,0,Liverpool show unity with absent Díaz as they sweep aside Nottingham Forest,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/29/liverpool-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-29,"Luis Díaz was on Liverpool minds throughout, news of his parents’ kidnapping in Colombia making preparations for Nottingham Forest’s visit “the most difficult I’ve ever had in my life” according to Jürgen Klopp. It speaks volumes about his team’s professionalism, togetherness and quality how Forest were dismissed with consummate ease to make it eight wins in eight appearances at Anfield this season. Díaz was understandably absent from the squad amid his family ordeal. His replacement, Diogo Jota, got his fifth goal of the campaign before Darwin Núñez and Mohamed Salah strikes delivered a more accurate reflection of Liverpool’s superiority. Cody Gakpo thought he had made it four in injury time but was denied by a VAR review for offside. Not since 1985-86, when Kenny Dalglish’s team won a league and FA Cup double, have Liverpool started a home campaign with eight or more consecutive wins. “I told the boys after the game that it is a really good sign that they played so well and still have so much space for improvement,” said Klopp. Liverpool were up against a deep defensive block for the second Premier League home game in succession and, as in the Merseyside derby, struggled to break down their opponents until capitalising on a centre-back’s mistake. That said, the hosts were supremely comfortable in possession before the opening goal, revelling in their command of Forest and patient in the knowledge their time would come. Steve Cooper set up the visitors in a 5-4-1 after a hamstring injury sustained by Chris Wood, and with Taiwo Awoniyi only on the bench after a layoff, severely reduced Forest’s striking options. “Two days ago we had prepared with a back four but we were forced to change by Chris’s injury and only had Anthony [Elanga] who could start as a 9,” said the Forest manager. “No excuses there, but the plan was to play on a small pitch against Liverpool. If you open it up and play on a big pitch they are one of the best teams in the world in that situation.” The defensive approach must have been draining for attack-minded players such as Morgan Gibbs-White, Nicolás Domínguez and Elanga but Forest’s carelessness in possession, on the few occasions they did have the ball, was their biggest problem. Both first-half goals stemmed from Forest losing the ball in the Liverpool half and being carved open before they had a chance to regroup. Liverpool’s breakthrough arrived when Murillo, who had started well on the left of Forest’s three-man central defence, got carried away attempting to dribble through the home midfield. His run was halted by Alexis Mac Allister, who enjoyed another quietly impressive game in the holding midfield role and released Salah on the counterattack. Forest were exposed for the first time, outnumbered three v two, and though Matt Turner parried Núñez’s drive from Salah’s pass the rebound fell kindly for Jota to convert. Jota celebrated by sprinting to the Liverpool bench to collect his teammate’s No 7 shirt, which he paraded to all four sides of the stadium. Another considerate, classy touch was shown before kick-off by the Forest fans, who displayed a banner that read: “Respect the 97 – solidarity with survivors – no to tragedy chanting” for the second season running at Anfield. Cooper’s gameplan had to change but Forest were caught out for a second time minutes after Jota’s opener. After a visiting attack broke down on the edge of the Liverpool area Jota sparked another devastating counter when finding Dominik Szoboszlai in space in midfield. The Hungary international exchanged passes with Salah, who released Szoboszlai to the byline with a brilliantly disguised ball. Núñez volleyed the midfielder’s first-time cross into the roof of the net from close range, and Liverpool were comfortably on course for another home win. Turner parried long-range shots from Ryan Gravenberch and Szoboszlai in quick succession as Liverpool pressed for a third before the break. It was a risky strategy from the American goalkeeper, especially as he kept parrying shots back into the danger zone, but a bigger calamity awaited him in a more subdued second half. Turner sprinted out his area in an attempt to intercept a searching long ball from Szoboszlai but misread the flight. He had no need to rush out with the substitute Harry Toffolo covering but the ball sailed over Turner and left Salah with an open goal for his latest slice of Liverpool history. Salah rolled home the gift to become the third Liverpool player to score in the opening five home league games of a season, after Harry Chambers in 1922 and John Aldridge in 1987. Forest carried more of a threat after the interval – they couldn’t have carried less of one – but Nicolás Domínguez failed to connect with a Morg an Gibbs-White cross in front of goal and Elanga sent a volley crashing against the crossbar from Ryan Yates’s centre."
Villa,3,Luton,1,McGinn and Diaby ease Aston Villa past Luton – with a little help from Lockyer,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/29/aston-villa-luton-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-29,"The last time Emiliano Martínez scored a late own goal, after the ball rebounded off the woodwork and in off the back of his head, Aston Villa were unlucky to lose to Arsenal. Since then, however, Unai Emery’s team have been just about perfect at Villa Park, winning all 12 Premier League games, scoring 34 times in the process. The Argentina goalkeeper’s misfortune on this occasion, after Ezri Konsa had nonchalantly headed against his own bar with Villa three goals to the good, was the only blip on an afternoon when Villa barely had to break sweat to consolidate fifth place. Especially once Villa went ahead, through John McGinn’s fourth goal of the season in the 17th minute, the match resembled more of a training game of attack versus defence than an equitable top-flight contest. The mismatch between these sides who were four divisions apart only nine years ago was epitomised by the Luton fans predicting wryly: “Conference champions, you’ll never sing that.” Villa face Nottingham Forest, Fulham and Bournemouth inside their next four league games, albeit with Europa Conference home games and a trip to Tottenham in between, before they entertain Manchester City. So are they the real deal? Can Villa compare with the elite? “Ask me after we’ve played Man City,” Rob Edwards, Luton’s admiring manager and a former Villa player, said. “They’re certainly looking to be competing around that [top four] sort of level.” After an encouraging run of five points from five games, Edwards could be fairly satisfied with Luton’s damage-limitation job before the interval, but admitted: “There is a gulf between the teams. Villa are a brilliant team, full of confidence, with a great manager. So to be 3-0 down after an hour was a difficult moment. It was a difficult afternoon but I’m proud we finished strongly.” Emery’s team have taken 71 points from 35 league matches since he took over a year and a week ago. “We are winning games because we are very focused,” the Villa manager said but pinpointed when he expects to judge his team’s improvement. “We lost to Newcastle 5-1 and Liverpool 3-0 and they were better than us,” he said. “That is the reality when we play the top teams. Hopefully we can reduce the distance between us and them. When we lost against Newcastle and Liverpool I told the players that I want to reduce the distance between us and them in those matches when we play them at home. In those matches, we will show whether it’s possible or not.” Luton soon defaulted to their 5-4-1 shape, allowing Villa to flicker between a narrow 4-4-2 when out of possession and the 3-4-3 that has done for far better-resourced sides this season. Nicolò Zaniolo volleyed wide from close range after being teed up by Ollie Watkins, then Thomas Kaminski made a sharp double save from the England striker after he seemed certain to convert Matty Cash’s superb low ball across the face of the six-yard box. McGinn’s goal came from a slick set-piece routine. Douglas Luiz laid the ball back towards the penalty spot where Moussa Diaby dummied and McGinn teed himself up to crack in a right-footed shot. Emery, wanting more width to help Villa penetrate, introduced Leon Bailey for the cautioned Zaniolo at the interval and was rewarded within four minutes. The substitute, who had also scored in Thursday’s 4-1 Europa Conference win at AZ Alkmaar, headed back Lucas Digne’s cross for Diaby to snap home a crisp left-footed half-volley. Then Boubacar Kamara emerged from his hybrid holding midfielder/ third centre-back role to play a delightful channel ball for Diaby. He played a pass towards the waiting Watkins but Tom Lockyer intervened, unfortunately touching the ball over his own line. When Luton did string a few passes together in their own half, Villa fans started chanting: “We want our ball back.” The home team were so comfortable that maintaining sharp focus for 90 minutes did prove too challenging. When one Luton substitute, Andros Townsend, crossed towards another, Elijah Adebayo, Konsa casually headed the ball back towards Martínez – only to see it go over his own goalkeeper’s head, hit the crossbar and rebound in off the Argentinian. But when you’ve already started the season by scoring 20 goals in five straight home wins, perhaps such nonchalance is understandable."
Brighton,1,Fulham,1,João Palhinha’s leveller earns Fulham point and frustrates Brighton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/29/brighton-fulham-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-29,"Sodden, shivering and almost – but not quite – smiling. Words that could have applied equally to Marco Silva and Roberto De Zerbi, who shared the south-coast spoils. For Silva, a point will have been deeply satisfying. Remember, he could so easily have been thousands of miles away enjoying sunshine and riches untold. Saudi Arabia called; Silva said no. Instead, the ink on a contract extension keeping him at Fulham until 2026 recently dried. And it is afternoons such as this, where his managerial mettle is tested to its maximum, that Silva relishes. Afternoons where a draw is earned via thought, determination and a superb João Palhinha equaliser. Remember this: for all the plaudits (rightly) poured upon Brighton over the past 13 months, Silva’s Fulham have taken four points at the Amex Stadium. In fact, despite losing Aleksandar Mitrovic, Fulham have one more point than at this stage last season. “I want to see us grow more and more,” Silva said. “I am really ambitious. I want to take steps forward – I am realistic at the same time – but I want to take more steps forward if we can.” For De Zerbi – a year on from a sweeping aside of Chelsea that will for ever be a touchstone of his time at Brighton – Evan Ferguson scored a deserved first-half opener. Brighton controlled huge portions of the match. But a failure to find a decisive second cost them two points. It ended up being a gentle tug back earthwards following a European high just 72 hours prior. “I think we played a great game, especially three days after Ajax,” De Zerbi said. “We conceded a goal in only one moment of five to seven minutes where we lost distances, where we lost the balance. We are frustrated with the result, but we can focus on the performance – the performance was great.” Fulham came to frustrate. They constantly, and sensibly, declined the hosts’ invitation to press. And so Brighton had to pull and stretch, poke and prod. Adam Lallana showed just what a lovely footballer he remains. A shimmy and cross saw Simon Adingra almost poke Brighton into the lead. Bernd Leno got there first. Just. Brighton’s goal came when Fulham forward Raúl Jiménez, not counting on Igor Julio’s close attention, was pickpocketed. Julio found Pascal Gross; a man puzzled by the apparent space in front of him – Silva would later bemoan his side’s lack of pre-interval aggression. Eventually, Gross raised his head to spot Ferguson. Making a run? No, simply standing between Antonee Robinson and Tim Ream. In mitigation, the Fulham pair deemed Ferguson offside. But for Calvin Bassey’s mispositioning, he would have been. One Ferguson right-footed touch. One left-footed finish made to look far easier than it was. One De Zerbi pirouette of joy. The game needed chasing, but with an attack as potent as water, it was difficult, through the driving rain, to see Fulham doing any catching. Yet when Jiménez – who, after 32 goalless league games, needs a purple patch more luminous than his side’s pink outfit to have even a passable centre-forward’s numbers – departed just before the hour, something changed. Jiménez’s removal was part of an effective triple switch. Suddenly, Fulham pressed. Suddenly, Jason Steele’s pass put Gross under pressure. Suddenly, Alex Iwobi won possession and found the newly introduced Harry Wilson. His lay-off to Palhinha resulted in a spin and strike that left Steele standing. Brighton’s wait for a league clean sheet this season continues. By then, De Zerbi’s irritation was clearly visible. Had Lewis Dunk’s bar-grazing free-kick after half-time been a few inches lower, the equaliser might not have happened. Had Palhinha been punished for a first-half elbow on Gross, the equaliser would not have happened. The game’s final quarter was frantic, the polar opposite to the low intensity contest that had come before it. Fulham’s shape, two banks of primal footballing screen, sat tight. Brighton pushed. Hard. Ansu Fati drew a save from Leno; Adam Webster’s looping header was nodded off the line by Robinson; those occupying the two technical areas became increasingly tetchy. De Zerbi’s baseball cap was flung in disgust at a misplaced pass. Silva moved with purpose, covering every inch of his white-lined enclosure. And then the whistle went. Hands were shaken. Neither would have it any other way."
West Ham,0,Everton,1,Calvert-Lewin makes the difference as Everton claim three points at West Ham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/29/west-ham-everton-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-29,"The trick for Everton was finding the edge to go with their organisation. This was a resilient away performance, the kind to evoke memories of Sean Dyche’s best days at Burnley, but it might have gone unrewarded without a finisher in the team. West Ham, who are in danger of drifting into troubled waters after one win in six league matches, might have stolen something had Dominic Calvert‑Lewin not punished their lethargy with a clinical winning goal. This was proof that Everton, who moved five points clear of the bottom three with this deserved win, are a different proposition when Calvert-Lewin is fit and confident. The England international has had a horrible time with injuries but his importance shone brightly when he drove in his fourth goal of the season. Calvert-Lewin occupied his markers, linked the play and finished superbly when his chance arrived in the 51st minute; he did for Everton what Michail Antonio failed to provide for West Ham. Not that ruthlessness was the deciding factor. West Ham’s first shot on target arriving deep into added time summed up a lack of bite, but there was also casual defending and an approach in possession that stifled their creative talents, Mohammed Kudus and Lucas Paquetá. The sense is of a team in need of a manager capable of implementing an attacking philosophy. Unambitious football is the accusation aimed at David Moyes and, after a decent start to the season, the Scot will be concerned about his side’s dip. With his contract up at the end of the season, this lifelessness will do little for his hopes of earning a new deal. “Probably not as good as we liked,” Moyes said. “Everton defended the box really well. That’s the first game we’ve not scored a goal in this season. We might have had more of the ball today but that doesn’t matter. We weren’t able to open it up.” It had not been an easy week for Everton, who mourned the death of their chairman, Bill Kenwright, and heard suggestions they could be docked 12 points if found guilty of breaching financial fair play rules. However, their focus was unaffected. With their back four sitting back, the visitors clearly knew how to play West Ham. “It’s befitting to win after the sad loss of the chairman,” Dyche said. “It’s a very good performance. Dom’s a very good player and has had a tough couple of years. We’re improving from last season. There’s clear signs of that.” The London Stadium grew frustrated as West Ham huffed and puffed. Before kick-off there was excitement at a bolder selection from Moyes, Tomas Soucek making way for Kudus to play as the No 10, but the optimism quickly faded. Jordan Pickford did not make a first-half save. Dominating possession did not suit West Ham, who prefer to counterattack. Everton were only opened up when Paquetá flickered into view. The moment of the half was undoubtedly when Paquetá lobbed Everton’s right-back, Nathan Patterson, and crossed for Jarrod Bowen to scuff wide. It was flat. There were a few flourishes from Kudus, but West Ham were reliant on individual improvisation. Vitalii Mykolenko shackled Bowen, and Antonio never stretched James Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite. Everton grew in belief, particularly with James Garner, Abdoulaye Doucouré and Amadou Onana overpowering Edson Álvarez and James Ward- Prowse in midfield. They should have led when Paquetá lost possession, only for Jack Harrison to shoot selfishly at Alphonse Areola. West Ham, who will be without the suspended Paquetá and Álvarez against Brentford this Saturday, needed more intensity. Part of the problem was that they were without Emerson Palmieri, whose adventurousness from left-back gives the side more dynamism. Aaron Cresswell was nowhere near as effective. At least Cresswell offered a threat over set pieces, delivering one for Bowen to head over at the start of the second half. Yet West Ham were edgy. That was evident in the defensive miscommunication that saw Kurt Zouma ignore a shout from Areola when the goalkeeper came to claim a cross. West Ham were also loose. They suffered because of Antonio repeatedly losing out to Branthwaite, a theme that continued when the young centre-back dispossessed the forward before Everton’s goal. There was no resistance as Branthwaite strode forward and found Calvert-Lewin. An exchange of passes with Harrison followed while West Ham stood and watched. Then Nayef Aguerd and Zouma were beaten by a beautiful turn from Calvert-Lewin, who drilled in a wonderful low shot from 18 yards. That was pretty much that. Everton chased a second, Doucouré and Dwight McNeil drawing fine saves from Areola, and held out with ease. With Paquetá short of conviction and Saïd Benrahma ineffective after replacing Antonio, West Ham remained insipid. Bowen had a chance and Pickford saved Benrahma’s volley in stoppage time but an equaliser was never on the cards. These are worrying times for Moyes."
Bournemouth,2,Burnley,1,Billing wonder strike sinks Burnley to give Iraola first Bournemouth win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/28/bournemouth-burnley-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-28,"Vincent Kompany had no qualms about the lengthy delay to check an offside call late on in Burnley’s defeat, but was incensed by the decision not to review a possible Bournemouth handball in the final moments of the match. The Clarets suffered an eighth defeat of the campaign after goals by Antoine Semenyo and Philip Billing cancelled out Charlie Taylor’s sweet strike in the 11th minute. A controversial moment occurred after 89 minutes when Jay Rodriguez fired into the bottom corner and – although it was immediately ruled out for offside – the video assistant referee David Coote at Stockley Park took six minutes to review it. Initially, a green line was drawn to signal it was onside before a new line was drawn, which showed red and it was eventually ruled out, but Kompany was left stunned that what he considered a handball by Chris Mepham was not checked in the eighth minute of added time. Mepham and the Burnley substitute Sander Berge tangled from a Taylor cross which resulted in the Bournemouth goalkeeper Andrei Radu making a close-range save that appeared to be from Berge’s head, but Kompany stated it was actually via Mepham’s hand. Kompany said: “Games get played on a knife edge but I am trying still to wrap my head around what happened in that moment of time. We take five to seven minutes to review the offside or not offside. The line goes green which means goal, the line goes red which means it is not a goal. “OK, I am a person who always believes in the fact they have taken their time because they want to make the right decision. And a decision gets given against us. “Tough one to take but then when the situation happens in the last moment of the game and we don’t take time to review the handball? There is no call to the referee to delay play when the players have called for it and the staff on the bench, we could see with a wide angle that there was a handball. “It is the hand that brings the ball down. And there is no check, no delay for the restart and the ball goes and we lose the game. I am trying to understand what is happening in that moment.” Kompany spoke to the referee, Sam Barrott, after the match. He added: “I think for the first time in my career since I have been a manager I have actually politely and calmly gone to ask for a word of explanation from the officials. “They were very open with me and they seemed surprised by the fact we would have liked this [handball] to go to VAR, so it means no one from VAR has told them it was worth reviewing. “When you look at it, it is as blatant as it can be. I’m fairly confident this one would have taken them 15 seconds [to review].” Andoni Iraola – who said he had not seen the handball – was in a far better mood, able to toast a first Premier League win at the 10th time of asking thanks to Semenyo’s fine solo goal and Billing’s 76th-minute lob from 40 yards. “Obviously happy, relieved because I think it was a needed victory for us,” the Bournemouth manager said. “Probably when you are in this situation everything costs a lot more. It happened today. We really deserved to win today but with the last VAR decision of the offside, we had to suffer until the end. We all were remembering the Brentford game in stoppage-time and thinking: ‘It cannot happen again.’ We deserved to win clearly the game.”"
Wolves,2,Newcastle,2,Hwang the hero as Wolves twice come from behind to frustrate Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/28/wolves-newcastle-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-28,"In the battle of the former Bournemouth managers, neither Eddie Howe nor Gary O’Neil could prevail. A full-blooded contest contained much high-end flair though another reminder that VAR serves to incite criticism and pressure on referees rather than make their life easier. Anthony Taylor, the referee, delivered a series of debatable – and unpopular – decisions, including the penalty from which Callum Wilson scored his and Newcastle’s second. Taylor departed the scene to boos from home fans who had jeered his every subsequent decision; Stockley Park had taken an age to back the penalty call. The longer the video-room deliberation, the more suspicious the paying public become. Wolves, fired by injustice, eventually found their deserved equaliser through a twisting, turning Hwang Hee-chan, the Korean having given away the fateful penalty. Before that, Newcastle had looked likely to shake off their Champions League hangover and an in-form, dangerous opponent but as O’Neil said of his team: “We suffered a few setbacks out there and the lads held together.” With Sandro Tonali’s worldwide ban for gambling confirmed by Fifa, Howe’s selection had been limited. He would make only one substitution. His squad are feeling the burn of Champions League football after injuries to Jacob Murphy and Alexander Isak against Borussia Dortmund. Drawing at Wolves completed what Howe called “a tough mental week, what with the Sandro situation”. “I don’t think the schedule has necessarily caught up with us, more the injuries,” continued Newcastle’s manager. “You won’t find me moaning about the schedule.” Amid the mizzle of Molineux, Pedro Neto, Wolves’ maestro, gave an early indication of his danger to those in Saudi Arabian green in blazing past a toiling Dan Burn, only to later leave the field with a hamstring problem. Hwang, who eventually matched the early-season Wolves goalscoring feat of old-gold icon Derek Dougan 50 years ago in scoring six goals from 10 matches, was equally lively from the start. Having revealed the secrets of his success in last week’s vindicating victory over Bournemouth on Monday Night Football, O’Neil’s team pressed high and fiercely. That press produced an early uncharacteristic error from Kieran Trippier to prelude an uncomfortable evening for the England player. Unfortunately for Wolves, Matheus Cunha’s finishing is yet to match the quality of the rest of his play. Wolves were soon doubly punished as José Sá dropped Anthony Gordon’s cross into the path of Wilson, who gobbled up the chance to pass Shola Ameobi and Andy Cole in the table of Newcastle’s Premier League goalscorers. Mario Lemina’s equalising header, from Neto’s corner, was just reward for Wolves’ endeavours. It also meant Neto passed Trippier to top the Premier League assists charts. Far more importantly, Trippier himself had been culpable with lax marking. Hwang was the next to make an enforced error, with a challenge on Fabian Schär leading Taylor to award the penalty, but there was an interminable wait for the VAR review. Hwang looked to have kicked the ground first rather than the Newcastle defender. “Contentious … a strange one” admitted Howe. “A scandalous decision,” said O’Neil, “and really surprising it wasn’t overturned. I waste my time talking to them so I won’t bother until they improve.” Sá’s chance for redemption was denied when getting a hand to Wilson’s spot-kick, though not enough. At half-time, the concourses were grumbling; a claim for a possible Bruno Guimarães handball had been waved away to a wild-eyed O’Neil’s displeasure and the Premier League’s probity being loudly called into question by an angry Jack Hayward Stand. “If that was us, you’d send him off,” Wolves fans sang after Hwang’s run was blocked by Jamaal Lascelles and a yellow rather than red card resulted. Such discontent was soon converted to defiant, spittle-flecked joy as Hwang slalomed past Burn to slot home, completing fine support play from Toti Gomes. “After I gave them a penalty I felt so sad so I really wanted to do something for my team,” said Hwang, luckless unfortunate turned hero. The end-to-end thrills continued. Schär flashed a header wide, O’Neil introduced Sasa Kalajdzic for the limping Neto, the giant Austrian asking awkward questions of the Newcastle defence. One impressive takedown of a lofted ball caused panic in the Newcastle area but, despite the exhortations of their frantic, sodden managers, neither’s team could find a winner.  This story was corrected on 28 October 2023 to reflect the fact that Sasa Kalajdzic is Austrian, not a Serb"
Arsenal,5,Sheffield,0,Eddie Nketiah puts on show with hat-trick in Arsenal rout of Sheffield United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/28/arsenal-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-28,"So much for Arsenal missing Gabriel Jesus. With a first Premier League hat-trick of his career and the captain’s armband wrapped around his right biceps, this was a spectacular manner for Eddie Nketiah to banish any fears of the Brazilian’s absence proving costly. “I’m here,” said Nketiah, jabbing his finger at the Emirates turf after his thunderbolt third goal fired home from all of 25 yards. The academy graduate has been a fixture in this part of north London for some time and, while he may sometimes flatter to deceive, he is clearly not prepared to relinquish control yet. Before this game, some fans had bemoaned his inclusion in place of the injured Jesus, who has been ruled out for a number of weeks with a hamstring injury picked up during his inspirational performance against Sevilla on Tuesday. By the end, they were singing Nketiah’s name. Called that one wrong, eh? Of course, it was only against a Sheffield United side killing time before a return to the Championship. But what a show from one of Arsenal’s own. That Bukayo Saka – captain in place of the rested Martin Ødegaard – had given him the armband when departing in the second half merely added to Nketiah’s pride as he carried the match ball off at the final whistle. The only minor disappointment came in his denial of a fourth goal, when the substitute Fábio Vieira was allowed to take – and score – the late penalty he had earned. Takehiro Tomiyasu then added a fifth deep in added time. Mikel Arteta’s side are up to second and the title quest shows no sign of slowing. Reports had emerged this week that poor Paul Heckingbottom might imminently be relieved of his duties at Sheffield United. If his time does come to an end, one wonders what anyone else could do with a squad palpably inadequate for this level of football – and one that has suffered a horror run of injuries to further deplete the weapons at his disposal. United have now picked up just one point from 10 games – the same tally they managed at the start of a 2020-21 season in which they claimed only two points from their first 17 fixtures (a Premier League record) and were relegated. How they can possibly avoid the same fate this campaign remains a mystery. This trip to the Emirates was something of a shot to nothing for Heckingbottom, whose side should not be judged on how they perform against the division’s elite. But days like this will surely leave psychological scars. A measure of the visitors’ desperation was evident as early as the 15th minute when Gustavo Hamer carried the ball over halfway and shanked an attempted 50-yard shot (so lacking in threat that it ranked an impotent 0.01 on expected goals) which only just dribbled across the line, nearer the corner flag than the goal. For almost half an hour, United did all they were capable of – namely, defending – with aplomb. They frustrated Arsenal, organising themselves diligently and restricting the home side to distant views of Wes Foderingham’s goal. But no sooner had the first impatient whistles begun to emanate from Arsenal’s supporters than the home side went ahead and never looked back. With time to identify his target, Declan Rice’s fizzed pass found the feet of Nketiah, whose first touch near the penalty spot took the ball past his defender and second fired it into the back of the net. Any hope that the visitors could cling on and find a route back into the game dissolved five minutes into the second half when Foderingham flapped at an Arsenal corner, palming the ball straight to Nketiah, who lashed home from inside the six-yard box. As the Sheffield United outfield players surrounded the referee to complain that Foderingham had been fouled, the goalkeeper was conspicuous by his absence and the video assistant referee spotted no infringement. Eight minutes later, Nketiah had his thunderous third, turning on the ball and crashing a powerful drive high into the top corner from distance; a sublime strike that sent the Emirates into raptures. There was still time for two more late Arsenal goals. The referee, Tim Robinson, initially decided there was nothing wrong with Oliver Norwood’s lunge on Vieira, but the VAR advised him to have another look and he pointed to the penalty spot after viewing replays. The Portuguese picked himself up and stroked it home. His fellow substitute Tomiyasu completed the rout by crashing in a bouncing ball from close range for his first Arsenal goal."
Chelsea,0,Brentford,2,Chelsea rocked as Bryan Mbeumo’s late strike seals Brentford victory,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/28/chelsea-brentford-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-28,"If they did not hold the mantle already, Brentford cemented their status as Chelsea’s bogey side with a third straight Premier League win at Stamford Bridge. This past week Mauricio Pochettino acknowledged Chelsea remain far away from where he expects them to be and on this evidence there is still a long way to go. The brutal reality is they have won one of their past 13 home league matches and overcome only Crystal Palace, Luton and Leeds here in the competition this year. If anything encapsulated Chelsea’s frustrations it was the sight of Jesús Pérez storming into the Brentford dugout to have words with the analyst Bernardo Cueva, a contretemps that triggered the referee, Simon Hooper, taking charge of his first top-flight game since the embarrassing VAR error in Tottenham’s win over Liverpool, to award the Chelsea assistant manager a red card. Chelsea have spent more than £1bn on furnishing their squad with some of the biggest talents in the game since the Todd Boehly-led takeover last year and until Bryan Mbeumo capped a counterattack after Chelsea committed everyone forward for a stoppage-time corner in search of an equaliser, it seemed the only goalscorer – and ultimate match-winner – would be Ethan Pinnock, who became Brentford’s £3m record buy upon signing from Barnsley in 2019, after a career in non-league. Yehor Yarmolyuk missed a golden chance to double Brentford’s advantage after they streamed forward four v two with a minute of normal time to spare but Mbeumo added a second soon after. Neal Maupay, 13 months without a goal, raced towards an empty net with the Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sánchez haring after him and just as it seemed the Brentford striker may have fluffed his lines he located Mbeumo to his left and passed on duties. The goal was cleared by VAR after Mbeumo appeared to foul the Chelsea substitute Ian Maatsen in the buildup. The first half felt like an exercise of attack v defence but the longer the game remained goalless the more edgy Chelsea became and the more Brentford’s belief grew. Their low block gnawed at Chelsea, whose players often looked up only to discover traffic in the shape of red-and-white shirts before them. Noni Madueke, promoted to the starting lineup, rattled the crossbar after 10 minutes with a fine strike but otherwise Chelsea were constrained to half chances. “We were not nasty or clinical in front of goal,” conceded Pochettino. Brentford had to suffer but in another sense they enjoyed suffocating Chelsea’s attack, congesting territory close to the 18-yard box. Mbeumo was selfless up front, earning a pat on the back from his manager, Thomas Frank, after buying a throw-in near the halfway line. The sight of Brentford’s left centre-back Nathan Collins pressing Cole Palmer practically all the way to the Chelsea goalline underlined Brentford’s determination to make life uncomfortable. It was a damning indictment for Chelsea and their latest summer splurge that, aside from the hosts’ early promise, Brentford always appeared the more likely to strike. As was Frank downplaying his side’s performance after recording successive victories for the first time this season. “I think our first half was not that good, average, if not a little less than that,” he said. “In the first half you could see the exciting potential in a Chelsea team. If I was a Chelsea supporter, I’d be positive about them and I’m convinced it will come [for them].” Pochettino, without Enzo Fernández and Mykhailo Mudryk owing to minor muscle injuries, made three changes from their entertaining draw with Arsenal. One of those added to his starting lineup, Nicolas Jackson, sent an early shot wide of a post and from there his afternoon did not get much better. On the verge of half-time a Chelsea supporter a few rows behind the dugout made his feelings plain to Jackson. An animated Pochettino responded by offering the fan a sharp-tongued riposte. “In this moment the energy was a little down in the stadium,” Pochettino said. “I said: ‘Stop talking in this way. Come on, we need support and [for the fans] to stay behind the team.’ I was very respectful.” Brentford had the first real chance of the second half, Sánchez repelling an effort by Vitaly Janelt after the marauding Brentford centre-back Kristoffer Ajer picked out the midfielder with a first-time pass from the byline. Brentford seized the lead when another roaming centre-half, this time Pinnock, feasted on some slack marking by Axel Disasi to bury a header. Mbeumo sent in a hanging cross from the right and Pinnock displayed the most hunger in the box to power in."
Palace,1,Spurs,2,Son Heung-min strikes as Tottenham hold off Crystal Palace to stretch lead,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/27/son-heung-min-strikes-as-tottenham-sink-crystal-palace-to-stretch-lead,2023-10-27,"Things are falling into place perfectly for Ange Postecoglou. A second routine victory over London rivals in the space of five days courtesy of Joel Ward’s own goal and Son Heung-min’s eighth league goal of the season took Tottenham five points clear at the top of the table and wondering just how far they can go this season. It wasn’t exactly the free-flowing football that this Spurs side has made its trademark under their exciting new manager but having been frustrated by a dogged Palace defence in the first half, a moment of inspiration from James Maddison finally found the breakthrough they were looking for. A visit to this ground is never an easy proposition for any title challengers yet even with Roy Hodgson celebrating his 500th game in charge of English clubs in all competitions, Tottenham passed their latest test with flying colours even after Jordan Ayew’s late consolation strike had threatened a comeback from Palace. Judging by the celebrations in the away end at the final whistle, the magnitude of this result was not lost on those who made the trip south of the river. As Tottenham supporters are becoming used to, Postecoglou had appeared completely unflustered by his team’s late arrival after they got stuck in Friday night traffic jams, acknowledging that “these things happen in life” in his pre-match interview. Only Bill Nicholson’s 1961 double-winners have made a better start to a top-flight campaign and the Australian did nothing to discourage hopes that this Tottenham side can sustain their flying momentum after beating Fulham 2-0 on Monday night. “Let them dream – that’s what being a football supporter is all about,” he said. “It’s fair to say this lot have suffered a fair bit so I’m certainly not going to dampen that. For me what is important is that we are giving our supporters some joy and some hope. That’s what football clubs are there for.” Hodgson admitted that his opposite number’s successful start to life at Spurs had come as no surprise to him having previously locked horns when Postecoglou was in charge of Australia back in 2016. But despite still lacking the creativity of Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise, Hodgson had promised a response from his players after their 4-0 thrashing at Newcastle last week against the league leaders. Palace certainly appeared up for the challenge under the lights and could have taken the lead twice inside the opening 10 minutes. Will Hughes looked like he was through on goal but still managed to play in Ayew after struggling to outpace the Tottenham defence, only for Guglielmo Vicario to deny the Ghana forward. It took a better save from the Italian to deny Odsonne Édouard’s effort 90 seconds later as the hosts stepped up the pressure. Tottenham slowly found their feet, however, with one probing run down the left flank from Maddison ending when his cross was cleared by Jefferson Lerma with Son lurking. It took a timely interception from Lerma to sweep the ball away from Maddison just as he was shaping to shoot from the edge of the box before Édouard’s touch let him down inside the area. A series of corners ended with Joachim Andersen heading well over as Palace finished the first half strongly. Tottenham failed to muster a single shot on target in the first 45 minutes and Postecoglou responded to his side’s lacklustre performance by withdrawing Ben Davies for Emerson Royal at the break. Hodgson had only tasted victory against Spurs once before in 20 previous Premier League meetings but must have sensed a real opportunity when Jeffrey Schlupp’s cross almost deflected into the path of Édouard. But those hopes were immediately dashed when Maddison found space inside the Palace area and his cross was inadvertently turned into his own net by Ward despite a lack of pressure around him. “It was a big moment in the game,” admitted Hodgson. The hosts almost responded to their setback straightaway, only for Marc Guéhi to badly misdirect his header from a Hughes corner. Having laboured to 0-0 draws in successive matches here against Fulham and Nottingham Forest, Palace’s prospects of finding a way back into the game appeared bleak. That was underlined when Son doubled Tottenham’s lead when he rounded off a flowing move down the left involving Maddison and a deft touch from substitute Brennan Johnson to set up the South Korean for a tap-in. Palace continued to press forward in the hope of setting up a grand finale and were given hope in stoppage time when Ayew volleyed home spectacularly from the edge of the penalty area, with VAR taking several minutes to confirm he had not used his hand to control the ball. Had Brazilian Matheus Franca managed to direct his effort on target with the last kick of the match then Palace would have completed the most unlikely of comebacks. “We’re top of the league,” sang the away supporters when Tottenham’s victory was finally confirmed. How long they can stay there will be fascinating to watch."
Spurs,2,Fulham,0,Spurs return to top of Premier League after Son and Maddison see off Fulham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/23/tottenham-fulham-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-23,"When Tottenham play like this, overwhelming the opposition with their energy, desire and creativity, it does not feel outlandish to suggest that they will soon be seen as genuine title challengers. Perhaps there will come a time when a light squad runs out of steam and the natural order resumes. Yet there is no stopping Spurs at the moment and, after they moved back to the top of the Premier League with this win over a toothless Fulham, the scenes that followed made it tempting to conclude that anything is possible under Ange Postecoglou. Spurs, who remain unbeaten, are not just a team transformed by Postecoglou; they are a club transformed. The supporters have totally bought into the Australian and were bellowing his name into the north London sky long after the final whistle, having earlier swooned at the commanding defending of Micky van de Ven and the way those sparkling goalscoring bursts from Son Heung-min and James Maddison are making up for the loss of Harry Kane. Fulham, whose defeat owed much to Calvin Bassey’s nightmarish defending, could be grateful it finished 2-0 after being blown away by the range of Postecoglou’s football. Spurs were merciless, twice punishing Bassey’s ropey distribution, and should have scored more. They push from every angle, the football quick and intuitive, inverted full-backs supporting the midfield. Maddison is at the heart of everything and, for players who laboured under the negativity of José Mourinho and Antonio Conte, Postecoglou’s ambition has given them a new lease of life. Intriguingly, though, Postecoglou was not entirely happy. Afterwards he spoke about a sloppy second half from Spurs, calling it the “worst 45 minutes we’ve had with the ball” all season. Fulham were almost offered a route back into the game and Guglielmo Vicario made some important stops. It was easy to imagine Postecoglou planning a tough few training sessions before taking Spurs to Crystal Palace on Friday. Yet Spurs still overran Fulham. There was a chance inside two minutes, Maddison sending Son through to extend Bernd Leno, and there was little suggestion that the hosts would miss the suspended Yves Bissouma. Pierre-Emile Højbjerg stepped seamlessly into midfield and Spurs dominated. Pedro Porro drew a desperate foul from Antonee Robinson after a surge from right-back and another opening went begging when a clever set piece ended with Van de Ven volleying over from close range after seven minutes. When Bobby De Cordova-Reid bumped Maddison over, leaving Spurs’ chief creative threat most aggrieved, it was easy to interpret it as a sign of Fulham trying anything to make their presence felt. Yet while the visitors have lacked incision since selling Aleksandar Mitrovic, Marco Silva is a smart manager. Fulham soon adjusted and went close when João Palhinha extended Vicario with a powerful header. Spurs looked flummoxed for a while, the frustration building when Dejan Kulusevski teed up Richarlison to shoot wide. One of the qualities that sets good sides apart, however, is the ability to trust in the plan. For Spurs that meant keeping the foot on the accelerator and continuing to hold a high line, which is easier to pull off with the speedy Van de Ven in central defence. The Dutchman has been a revelation since joining from Wolfsburg. His pace was on show when he raced across to stop Carlos Vinícius reaching a through-ball from Willian and his aggressive defending played a crucial role in Spurs going ahead in the 36th minute. The goal arrived when Bassey’s pass out from the back was intercepted by Van de Ven, who had advanced into Fulham’s half. The ball ran to Richarlison and Fulham were slow to recover. Son was alone in the centre and, found by Richarlison, the Spurs captain had time to swerve past a challenge before bending a beautiful right-footed shot beyond Leno. However, while Son’s composure underlined the belief running through Spurs, others were more wasteful. Kulusevski was most culpable, dithering when he was through on goal. Fulham had a chance to regroup. Silva reacted by replacing Vinícius and Andreas Pereira with Raúl Jiménez and Alex Iwobi at the start of the second half. Ever so briefly there was a different feel, with Spurs a little tentative and Fulham trying to assert themselves. Sadly, though, the resistance only lasted nine minutes. Spurs targeted Bassey and they profited when they pushed the centre-back into a dead end on the right. This time a rushed clearance fell to Højbjerg and, from there, it was a straightforward task for Son to send Maddison through to guide a low shot past Leno. At least Fulham, who remain 13th, avoided conceding again. Maddison almost punished another error from Bassey but Spurs had to fight for their clean sheet. Destiny Udogie was an adventurous marvel at left-back and Cristian Romero had to make some thunderous challenges. While Postecoglou wanted more, Spurs can dare to dream."
Villa,4,West Ham,1,Douglas Luiz shines as Aston Villa see off West Ham with a flourish to go fifth,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/22/aston-villa-west-ham-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-22,"Unai Emery can celebrate his first anniversary in charge of Aston Villa on Tuesday safe in the knowledge that he has turned his team into contenders to be considered among the best of the rest. Only Manchester City – the champions and leaders – Arsenal and Liverpool have gained more wins over this period and, with Douglas Luiz continuing his unlikely conversion into a prolific goalscoring midfielder, Villa sashayed to within two points of the top. Only Newcastle have scored more Premier League goals than Villa this autumn as they dismissed West Ham with a stylish display to reach 19 points, their best tally after nine games for 25 years. With five places in the Champions League likely to be available to the Premier League from this season, Villa could stay in the argument, though Emery is keeping a lid on his club’s ambitions. “One of our dreams is to be with the top seven teams and to do something in Europe,” he said, adding the names of Newcastle, Chelsea and Manchester United to those clubs currently above Villa, while reiterating his desire to win the Champions League one day. “To get European football is very important and that is the work we need to try to do. We need to be consistent in what we are doing.” It is difficult to avoid being swamped by the sheer torrent of numbers confirming Villa’s renaissance under Emery but somehow he has supplemented a discontented ensemble of decent players and turned his squad into a fluid and entertaining side with a solid backbone. The atmosphere at a sold-out Villa Park was vibrant, passionate and, after some dull times, grateful. Not since Dwight Yorke scored in eight successive top-flight home games in 1991 have Villa had such a prolific homebird as Douglas Luiz. Not bad for a holding midfielder whom Steven Gerrard was willing to offload last year. Backed by Boubacar Kamara in the heart of the midfield, Douglas Luiz has been granted more licence to support the attack alongside John McGinn, Moussa Diaby and, recalled here as Villa reverted to a four-man defence, Nicolò Zaniolo. Douglas Luiz was typecast as a defensive midfield pivot in his early days at Villa Park, and was strongly linked with a move to Arsenal when sidelined, but Emery has unshackled the more complete player. Villa and West Ham head off on European trips on Thursday but it is the Midlands club, winning their 11th successive top-flight game at home, who look far more ready on this evidence to stay competing for European qualification through the Premier League. They were superior for all but the 15 minutes after Douglas Luiz’s second goal made it 2-0 and it will be their supporters raising a glass of claret while the Hammers fans head back to London feeling blue. For the deserved breakthrough, Zaniolo played a neat ball back inside the penalty area for Ollie Watkins to tee up Douglas Luiz to dispatch a crisp and low right-footed shot. Zaniolo, withdrawn from the Italy squad to help the investigation into illegal betting activity, contributed tidily. He has let it be known he will contest any claims that he has bet on football. West Ham appeared reluctant to come out and play until they went 2-0 down. From Lucas Paquetá’s poor pass backwards, five minutes into the second half, Edson Álvarez fouled Ezri Konsa. Douglas Luiz chipped the penalty down the middle. Emery praised Douglas Luiz before urging him to improve. “It’s credit to him, firstly. I am very happy with him. But I think he can do better. There were some moments after he scored the two goals where we were trying to control the game and I wasn’t happy because he was too relaxed. “We have to see where we can improve in everybody. I was very demanding of the players to try and score another goal. After the third goal we controlled the game.” West Ham did respond, Jarrod Bowen scoring with a shot that deflected heavily off Pau Torres, equalling the divisional record with goals in his first five away games of a season. Just as West Ham were starting to turn the screw, however, Villa regained their two-goal buffer. John McGinn capitalised on Mo Kudus’s miscontrol, sending Watkins away down the inside-left channel with a pass that swerved enticingly into the striker’s path. One stepover later, Kurt Zouma sent for a hotdog, Watkins crashed a left-footed shot into the near top corner for his ninth goal for club and country this season. “We’ve done a lot of good things this season,” David Moyes said of his West Ham side, “but today we didn’t do a lot right.” Leon Bailey made it 4-1 in the 89th minute as he stepped inside Nayef Aguerd and shovelled his left-footed shot into the top corner. It is the first time since 1920 that Villa have scored at least three goals in each of their opening four home league games."
Forest,2,Luton,2,Elijah Adebayo strikes to complete late Luton comeback and deny Forest,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/21/nottingham-forest-luton-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-21,"Rob Edwards hailed “magic” super-sub Elijah Adebayo after the striker’s stoppage-time equaliser saw Luton salvage an unlikely point at Nottingham Forest. Forest led 2-0 in the 83rd minute through Chris Wood’s second-half double, but Chiedozie Ogbene gave the Hatters a lifeline and Adebayo’s superb effort snatched them a point. The 25-year-old took Tom Lockyer’s long ball into the box on his chest and buried a low shot in the second minute of added time as Luton, promoted via the playoffs in May, registered just their fifth point from nine matches. The Luton manager, Edwards, said: “It was a great goal. He’s got those moments. He came on against Burnley and got his goal and he’s done it again today. “He’s got these little moments of magic in him. The assist he got at Sheffield United, the assist at Wembley.. “He was frustrated not to start the game, as I would expect, but that’s what you’ve got to do when you come on. That’s what I want. He gives me a difficult decision to make next week.” Forest forced the early pressure as Wood’s volley was held by Luton goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski and Ibrahim Sangaré headed narrowly over. Luton responded through Ogbene’s low cross, which narrowly evaded teammates Carlton Morris and Brown. Morris fired a low shot wide as Luton made their intentions clear by committing men forward on the counter before another first-time effort from Wood deflected off Teden Mengi for a corner. Tahith Chong’s shot from outside the box was comfortably saved by Forest goalkeeper Matt Turner and Wood failed to get his header on target from Serge Aurier’s cross. Forest went close again on the stroke of half-time when Sangaré somehow missed the target from Morgan Gibbs-White’s low ball across the six-yard box. But the home side broke the deadlock three minutes into the second period. Anthony Elanga threaded a neat through ball into Wood’s path and the striker provided an emphatic left-footed finish. Wood should have made it 2-0 moments later when he headed Aurier’s excellent cross inches over. Wood appeared to have sealed the points for Steve Cooper’s side with a fine header from Elanga’s pinpoint, inswinging cross with 14 minutes remaining. But the Hatters refused to lie down. Their appeals for a penalty as Morris went down inside the box were dashed by VAR before Ogbene lashed home a volley from eight yards, which stood after another VAR check. Still the visitors were not finished. Tom Lockyer launched a long ball into Forest’s penalty area and Adebayo took it superbly on his chest before firing home to haul his side level. Edwards added: “I’m really proud of the players. The spirit, the fight and determination. We finish the game strongly. We will never give up, we will always keep fighting.” Nottingham Forest manager, Steve Cooper, could not hide his frustration after his side’s winless run was extended to five matches. “We dominated the game and we’re disappointed we weren’t leading by one or two goals at half-time. “We obviously got the early goal in the second half and then made it 2-0 and it all changes on a set-piece, which we defended terribly really. Of all Luton’s threats off set-plays, it was the worst delivery of the day and ends up in the back of our net and that’s where the momentum changes. “It’s a real pity because the way we played for however long it was before their first goal went in, it was a comfortable game for us.”"
Sheffield,1,United,2,Dalot’s stunner gives Manchester United hard-fought win at Sheffield United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/21/sheffield-united-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-21,"Diogo Dalot scored the kind of goal that Sir Bobby Charlton plundered by the barrel-load in his Manchester United days, and it settled an absorbing muck-and-nettles contest against struggling Sheffield United. It’s no secret that the Reds have slipped some distance from the days of Sir Bobby – many fans would now accept far less than the heights he scaled in his heyday – but the death of Manchester United’s greatest ever player cast a long shadow over this fixture, after the news broke four hours before kick-off. Charlton was part of the fabric of football, not just his old club. All sides of Bramall Lane stood and partook in the minute’s applause before kick-off – a mark of the esteem in which he was held over the Pennines, across the country and beyond. Erik ten Hag suggested some of his squad were inspired to mark the occasion with a win, Dalot among them. Harry Maguire may not belong in the same class as Charlton – few of Ten Hag’s crop do – but United were given a timely reminder of the importance of leadership as they came under siege under the Saturday‑night lights. The kind of leadership Sir Matt Busby harnessed when Charlton made his breakthrough alongside Duncan Edwards et al. Clearly at home in the South Yorkshire rough and tumble, Maguire embodied the United spirit on this unique occasion. He was applauded by the home supporters of his boyhood Blades before kick-off and then produced a man-of-the-match display to silence his many critics. He got an ovation from the visiting fans at the end as well. Perhaps it’s no coincidence that United have a 94% win rate with Maguire in the starting lineup over the past 12 months. OK, he could have joined West Ham in the summer, but with neither Lisandro Martínez or Raphaël Varane fit to start, Ten Hag was glad to have a leader in the man he took the captaincy away from. “Harry is playing like we want him to,” said Ten Hag. “He’s being proactive, he’s dominating his opponent, stepping in, reading the game but he’s also very proactive in possession, vertical passing, good switches. I’m very happy for him.” Bruno Fernandes led from the front too, setting aside his recent patchy form to set up Scott McTominay’s 28th-minute opener, and maintaining his menace in the second half to dovetail with the substitutes Christian Eriksen and Alejandro Garnacho; together they prompted a marked improvement from the visitors to run out deserved winners. Fernandes and Sofyan Amrabat struck the woodwork as United sought to re-establish their lead after the Blades equalised via Oli McBurnie’s penalty, which was slotted past André Onana after McTominay’s handball. But where his two teammates had narrowly erred Dalot did not, screaming home a 20-yard drive that ignited red flares in the away contingent. Garnacho had been the necessary spark on the pitch, combining with Victor Lindelöf who then squared for Dalot to seal it. It was no less than the men from Manchester had warranted, a strike Sir Bobby would have been proud of – albeit the display was far from vintage, Sir Bobby-era United. As Ten Hag said: “First half it wasn’t the standard of Sir Bobby Charlton. Second half was better.” McBurnie and Sheffield United reflected on an opportunity missed. “That is probably the story of our season,” he said. “We have been in a lot of games. It is tough to take. It’s unfortunate because I think the boys have defended really well for a lot of the game and the right-back sticks one in the bin from 25 yards.” His manager, Paul Heckingbottom, was emboldened by his side’s performance but they are still without a win. “Today we had more of an all-round threat, but I still thought we could have been better,” he said. A second successive hard-fought 2-1 win over one of the Premier League’s lesser lights will do little to sway Ten Hag’s critics. Here, he was indebted to Dalot, to Garnacho and, whisper it, to the Sheffield steel of Maguire, too. “I felt with the win we gave a little bit of joy on a sad day,” was Dalot’s conclusion."
Chelsea,2,Arsenal,2,Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard strike late to earn point for Arsenal at Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/21/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-21,"Arsenal looked finished. Trailing by two goals, there were just 13 minutes to go and the story looked set to be about a statement win for Mauricio Pochettino and Chelsea; Arsenal goalkeeping woe, too. David Raya was at fault for the Chelsea second, allowing a swirling ball in from Mykhailo Mudryk to sail over his head and drop into the far corner. Was it a visionary lob from the left or an intended cross? Only Mudryk knows. What was more obvious was that Raya’s positioning was suspect. He seemed to lose his bearings under the ball and was a good way off his line. Moments later, he would pass straight to Cole Palmer, who had opened the scoring from the penalty spot and was only just denied now by Raya for 3-0. It said everything about the frustration of the Arsenal support that they would chant the name of their deposed No 1 Aaron Ramsdale, who was absent from the bench after his wife gave birth to a baby boy. Yet Raya was not the only goalkeeper to suffer. Robert Sánchez saw Raya’s travails and re-raised. The Chelsea No 1 went for a low pass out and got it horribly wrong, missing blue and finding red in the shape of Declan Rice, who returned the ball with interest from 25 yards into the mainly empty net. Chelsea’s hold was broken, the comeback was on and Arsenal would complete it almost immediately after Pochettino had introduced his captain, Reece James, for his first football since the opening weekend of the season as part of a double substitution. James slotted in on the right of a midfield three, in front of the right-back, Malo Gusto, and it was the latter who lost another substitute, Leandro Trossard, after a Bukayo Saka cross. With Sánchez rooted to his line, Trossard steered home with the outside of his right boot. Chelsea had been the better side until Rice’s goal, their performance teeming with intensity. And yet Arsenal might have burgled all three points when another substitute, Eddie Nketiah, stretched in front of Thiago Silva to hook a shot just beyond the far post. Mikel Arteta looked as though he was ready to implode towards the end of seven minutes of stoppage time, balling up his fist and shaking it, his expression one of thunder after a decision had gone against his team. But the Arsenal manager had to be happy with the point, especially as the Chelsea substitute Nicolas Jackson had almost beaten Raya moments earlier. Arsenal were off colour in the opening 25 minutes, their passing loose, second best in the duels, and they were reeling when the penalty was awarded. Mudryk had headed a Gusto cross at goal and, in the moment, it really did look as if it had hit William Saliba’s hand. The referee, Chris Kavanagh, allowed the play to continue but the VAR wheels were turning and, moments after Marc Cucurella had chopped into Saka, Kavanagh was asked to take a look at the pitchside screen. Arsenal argued that Saliba was too close to get his hand out of the way, also that it is impossible to jump without using said limb for leverage. It was to no avail. Palmer’s kick was nerveless. It was feisty, Palmer booked early on for a scrape down the back of Gabriel Jesus’s heel, and it was easy to think that Cucurella had targeted Saka. Arteta was unhappy at Cucurella’s first challenge on Saka in the sixth minute; there were 17 on the clock when the full-back took another swipe at his opponent. There was irony to Cucurella’s yellow card on 71 minutes; the foul on Saka was the softest of the lot. Pochettino had started with Palmer at centre-forward, Conor Gallagher behind him. Gallagher had gone close at the very start, seeing a shot blocked by Ben White while he also released Palmer on the half hour, who dragged narrowly wide. What did Arsenal create before the interval? Very little, despite gradually establishing themselves higher up the pitch. A cross-cum-shot by Rice was not enough of one or the other. Jesus crossed to nobody after Sánchez had hared out of his area, on the left-hand side. Jesus also saw a shot blocked by Silva. Mudryk’s streaky goal was a hammer blow to Arsenal’s hopes and it had to be him, not only because of the narrative strand that clung to him – the one about how Arsenal tried to sign him before he went to Chelsea in January. The winger is finding his feet at Stamford Bridge, his confidence stabilising after a tricky start. Arsenal had their chances in the second half. Gabriel Martinelli saw a shot diverted wide by the outstanding Silva while the substitute Takehiro Tomiyasu headed over after Sánchez had bolted from his line on a corner. Gabriel Magalhães had another header blocked by Levi Colwill. But Pochettino was probably right to say it was closer to 3-0 than 2-1. Jackson ran through only for Raya to deny him and Palmer got a curled finish wrong. Chelsea were comfortable. Then they were not."
Brentford,3,Burnley,0,Bryan Mbeumo sparks Brentford victory to teach Burnley harsh lessons,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/21/brentford-burnley-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-21,"Thomas Frank celebrated five years at Brentford this past week, time in which he has established himself and his club in the Premier League. This season threatened to be his most difficult and a first league win since August, the first at home and over potential relegation rivals, proved most welcome. Their victory, including two spectacular goals, might have been more comfortable without another case of VAR confusion. Vincent Kompany and his team have much to learn from the west London club. “Overall, not good enough,” he admitted. Nine matches in, having beaten only Luton, there are serious grounds for concern over last season’s Championship winners. They failed to cope with what Frank described as the “high pressure, high intensity and big energy” of his team. Having faced four of last season’s top seven at Turf Moor, concerns about home form might be set aside but this commenced a crucial pair of away matches. Still winless Bournemouth follow next week but signs at the Gtech were unpromising from the start. Neal Maupay has gone 31 matches without a Premier League goal but should not have been allowed space to shoot wide from a Mathias Jensen free-kick in the opening seconds. Burnley appeared to be relying on Maupay’s lucklessness, and fell on the right side of the type of VAR ruling that damages the protocol’s reputation. Maupay slotted the ball in the net after Nathan Collins hooked the ball back for him to volley in. Kristoffer Ajer had been offside but did not look to be interfering with play, as was the official explanation that belatedly arrived. Frank was incandescent in arguing with the fourth official, Darren England, infamous for his role in Luis Díaz’s disallowed Liverpool goal at Tottenham. This time, the VAR decision maker was Stuart Attwell and Frank, while happy with the win, felt it was “borderline” at best. “Kristoffer is not affecting the situation,” he said. With Kompany raging, England was receiving pelters from both dugouts, though Brentford’s broke into cheer following their opener. Sander Berge was caught in midfield by Maupay and a switch of play with Bryan Mbeumo gave his attacking partner, Yoane Wissa, a tap-in. From the half-hour, Burnley were fortunate not to be several goals down; their out-balls to the lonesome Lyle Foster reeked of desperation. Frank, who revealed he would celebrate his anniversary and three points with “a good red wine and a little bit of tapas” pronounced his team’s first-half display as “maybe our best performance this season”. “Going in losing 1-0 was flattering for us,” Kompany admitted. “You can’t put in 45 minutes like that.” Not that Brentford fans lacked for anxiety. As chances came, a team that had surrendered 11 points from winning positions were in danger of squandering more once Burnley began the second half strongly. Frank was booked for more criticism of England but his mood improved after Maupay – his overall play excellent and who left the field to warm applause and an “eight or nine” rating” from his manager – set up Mbeumo for a lashing finish. Once the Burnley substitute Luca Koleosho missed from yards out after Foster’s break laid him a chance on a plate, and Connor Roberts was sent off for a second bookable offence, Burnley’s fate was sealed. Saman Ghoddos’s 25-yard wallop past Trafford pressed home how far Kompany and co must travel to emulate Frank and Brentford. “Can you still be resilient?” Kompany asked of his players. “Can you face the truth? It’s for us to pick ourselves up.”"
City,2,Brighton,1,Erling Haaland on target as 10-man Manchester City edge past Brighton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/21/manchester-city-brighton-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-21,"A lot has happened since Manchester City’s FA Cup third round victory over Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium in January. That was the start of a record-breaking run that helped City win a historic treble. Such triumphs can make it a struggle to find the motivation to keep improving but a 21st straight home victory in all competitions over Brighton, to surpass Manchester United’s run of 20 more than a decade ago, shows how high the standards are. As well as finding new methods of inspiring his team, a summer refresh of the squad has brought a new dynamic to City. One of those arrivals, Jérémy Doku was key to their attacking prowess here. Whenever the winger received the ball, there was a brief hush as fans awaited where his dribbles would finish, the answer usually being past James Milner, as the veteran was reminded of his 37 years and the fact he is not a full-back by trade. It caused Roberto De Zerbi to do the kindest thing by removing him at half-time, with Brighton behind thanks to goals from Julián Álvarez and Erling Haaland. “He is an exceptional winger, so smart and intuitive to get the ball,” Pep Guardiola said of Doku. “After the quality to beat one or two guys to the byline for the first goal. “Really pleased for his impact since he came into us and for many years to come in this house.” De Zerbi is one of the names tipped to replace Guardiola when he departs. His tactical acumen and eagerness to attack are key reasons behind his success. In the early stages Brighton went man-to-man with City’s back four, as they looked to target a perceived weakness but it took the introduction of Ansu Fati to wrestle control away from City. Few teams that go toe-to-toe with City come out of it well and Brighton were behind in the seventh minute. Doku’s pace was too much for Pascal Gross on the left wing, allowing him to reach the byline and pick out Álvarez who took aim with his left foot but miscued it, not that it mattered as the ball flew in off his right in-step for his 17th home goal in as many starts. Brighton worked hard, making them frustrated when Carlos Baleba gifted the ball to Haaland 20 yards from goal. He drove for the edge of the box and viciously sent his shot into the bottom corner with the sort of power the recently departed City legend Franny Lee would have been proud of. The quality available at Brighton is undeniable and they became more dangerous as the game went on. While Doku made Milner question his life choices, Kaoru Mitoma caused constant problems for Kyle Walker, one of the world’s best right-backs, in the second half to put City on the back foot. It was a very open game as City looked to end the match as a contest and Brighton to find hope. One second Lewis Dunk was clearing an Álvarez shot off the line with Jason Steele out of his goal and within moments, Brighton countered, with Mitoma causing the problems again down the left and Fati capitalising on a poor Manuel Akanji clearance to finish but they could not find an equaliser. “If we play with more courage and personality, we can play like we did in the second half,” De Zerbi said. “We were shy in the first half. We might lose 6-1 but that is not a problem because I want to play with personality.” In addition to completing a 14th away league match against City without a win, Brighton suffered the blow of Solly March suffering a serious injury, leaving him in distress before being taken off on a stretcher. For City, who finished the match with 10 men after Akanji received a second booking late on, this win will add a new paragraph to the record books but, more importantly, it got them back to winning ways after two straight defeats."
Newcastle,4,Palace,0,Callum Wilson completes rout as Newcastle put four past Crystal Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/21/newcastle-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-21,"There were moments when Roy Hodgson simply shook his head and others when he glanced, somewhat wistfully, at the electronic clock on the stadium scoreboard. As his Crystal Palace players looked increasingly in peril of being submerged by the relentless waves of defence-shredding, high-intensity Newcastle attacks, Hodgson must have longed to fast forward the agonising minutes remaining until the final whistle. “It didn’t work out today,” he said wryly. “We lacked control, we were nowhere near Newcastle’s level.” Eddie Howe could not have wished for a more confidence-affirming warm-up for Wednesday’s Champions League engagement with Borussia Dortmund here. “We were very good,” he said. “Really incisive and clinical.” Only four minutes had elapsed when Fabian Schär’s lofted ball out of defence was met by Kieran Trippier and passed on, sublimely, to Jacob Murphy. Within a millisecond Sam Johnstone was beaten by Murphy’s audacious lob but, before anyone had time to debate whether it had been sheer genius or a slight fluke, it was disallowed for an offside against Trippier. The England full-back shook his head in puzzlement and, sure enough, a VAR review prompted the overturning of the decision, leaving Murphy to lead the celebrations. With Newcastle firmly in control and the outstanding Trippier setting such formidably high standards it seemed impossible to believe he cost £12m, the ground echoed with choruses of “Sandro Tonali”. The £55m Italy midfielder, who is being investigated for alleged breaches of betting regulations in his home country, began on the bench. Given that his agent says his client has a “gambling addiction” it jarred somewhat when, as Tonali warmed up, both the electronic pitchside hoardings and the big screen projected vivid, flashing, advertisements for one of the three betting companies that rank among Newcastle’s sponsors. By then they could easily have been further ahead but Johnstone saved well to deny Murphy before performing a minor miracle to push Anthony Gordon’s high velocity volley on to the woodwork. Undeterred, Gordon soon scored, lashing home first time at the far post after surging into the area and meeting Murphy’s fine cross at the end of a move featuring Schär and Callum Wilson. A third goal arrived before half-time. Palace’s stumbling centre-half Marc Guéhi made heavy weather of a long ball, allowing Sean Longstaff to seize possession before beating Johnstone. Along with Gordon, Bruno Guimarães, Murphy and Trippier, Longstaff was one of Newcastle’s highest-calibre performers in the sort of brutally ruthless overall display capable of making Hodgson question the wisdom of emerging from retirement. Not to mention thoroughly alarming Dortmund scouts. With Jamaal Lascelles winning his physical duel with Jean-Philippe Mateta, Schär was frequently free to advance from defence and remind everyone what an accomplished footballer he is. If Sven Botman’s absence with a knee injury remains concerning, it has been mitigated by an apparently reinvented Lascelles returning to the heart of Newcastle’s backline. It spoke volumes that Palace’s first shot on target came in the 65th minute. Seconds after Nick Pope had been forced to dive low to deny Cheick Doucouré, Murphy’s through pass left the rapidly accelerating Wilson to complete the task of placing the ball beyond Johnstone’s reach. That prefaced a quadruple home substitution, with Tonali receiving a rapturous reception as he replaced Guimarães. At the end of an afternoon that suggested Newcastle should cope just fine without their marquee summer signing, Howe and his assistant, Jason Tindall, flanked a tearful Tonali as they led the team on a well-received lap of appreciation. “I’d like to say a big thank you to our supporters for their reaction on a very emotional day for Sandro,” Howe said. “You felt their love for him.”"
Bournemouth,1,Wolves,2,Kalajdzic completes Wolves comeback win at 10-man Bournemouth,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/21/bournemouth-wolves-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-21,"Bournemouth’s decision to sack Gary O’Neil in the summer looked harsh at the time and it is not looking any wiser with winter looming. Their former manager reminded them of his worth on his return, with Wolves overturning a half-time deficit to earn a deserved victory with a late winner from the substitute Sasa Kalajdzic. The defeat, with Bournemouth playing almost 40 minutes with 10 men after Lewis Cook’s reckless dismissal, resulted in their longest winless start to a league season – collecting three points from their first nine matches – with Andoni Iraola looking as if he is running short of time to vindicate his appointment as O’Neil’s successor. Dominic Solanke’s deft flick sparked hopes of a first league win under Iraola but Wolves would not be denied. Matheus Cunha curled home an equaliser 71 seconds into the second half and Cook’s headbutt resulted in a red card that exacerbated Bournemouth’s problems. Kalajdzic profited from the hosts’ defensive lapse to increase the gloom on the south coast. O’Neil refused to take any extra pleasure from his victorious return. The Wolves head coach, who guided Bournemouth to 15th in the league last season, said: “It’s not about me or returning to Bournemouth. It’s just a really good win for a group that are making progress. “I feel no different to when we beat Manchester City and Everton. It feels exactly the same. I have huge respect for everybody at Bournemouth. They gave me an opportunity to manage a Premier League team. It was a funny experience being back but I just enjoyed our performance.” Bournemouth took the lead with a move started by David Brooks and Philip Billing’s low cross was finished off supremely by Solanke’s backheel flick for his fourth league goal of the season. Pedro Neto was Wolves’ most threatening attacker but he was unable to keep a shot down from distance to the relief of the home fans. Wolves were dominating possession and it seemed only a matter of time before they exposed a brittle backline. Wolves did not have to wait too long for their equaliser, less than two minutes into the second half, with Neto, who provided his sixth assist of the season, laying the ball off to Cunha for the Brazilian attacker to curl the ball into the net. It got worse for Bournemouth after 54 minutes with their midfielder Cook dismissed for headbutting Hwang Hee-chan after the pair clashed. Wolves predictably dominated after the red card as they pushed for the winner their supremacy merited. Bournemouth’s forays into the opposing half were rare but the substitute Ryan Christie forced José Sá into a comfortable save from a decent position. The lively Cunha spotted the chance to score a second goal but his strike from the edge of the area was parried by the Bournemouth goalkeeper, Neto, and Hwang blasted the rebound over the target. Craig Dawson almost emerged as the unlikely matchwinner for Wolves but the centre-back’s low attempt from close range was parried to safety. The chances kept coming but Neto blasted over the crossbar from Rayan Aït-Nouri’s cross. Bournemouth still carried an occasional threat on the break, with Joe Rothwell’s fierce shot charged down and Billing’s shot held by Sá. But Wolves punished their opponents in the 88th minute when Billing was robbed of possession in his own half – after a short pass from Neto – enabling Hwang to play in the substitute Kalajdzic for a close-range finish to increase Iraola’s troubles at Bournemouth. Iraola said: “We have to find ways to win games. When you take all the matches, there are things that are costing us the wins. We are not having a game without making mistakes. They are costing us too much. “Nobody should be concerned about it [his position]. I’m concerned about Bournemouth winning games. It’s not a matter of my situation. It’s about how we can solve things.”"
Liverpool,2,Everton,0,Liverpool break down 10-man Everton’s resistance with Mohamed Salah double,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/21/liverpool-everton-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-21,"It looks routine enough. Liverpool beat Everton 2-0 at Anfield for the third season in succession, registering their 14th win in the past 24 Premier League home derbies and 99th in the fixture’s history, while Mohamed Salah made another decisive contribution to take Jürgen Klopp’s team briefly top of the table. It was anything but routine. It was gruelling, testing and controversial, with another weak refereeing display exerting an unhealthy influence over a showpiece event. This time Klopp had no complaints. Salah scored twice to shatter the resistance of a team reduced to 10 men by Ashley Young’s foolish dismissal in the 37th minute. The first arrived from a penalty awarded after VAR, not exactly Liverpool’s friend of late, sent Craig Pawson to review a clear handball he had missed by Michael Keane. Pawson, hesitant and inconsistent throughout, caused genuine consternation in the Everton ranks when failing to show a second yellow card to Ibrahima Konaté with the game goalless. “Ridiculous,” “baffling” and “impossible” were just some of the words Sean Dyche used to describe the decision. The Everton manager was well within his rights. His Liverpool counterpart has been there too recently and could only sympathise. The standard of refereeing in the Premier League continues to alarm. Liverpool dominated the 243rd Merseyside derby and took full advantage of their reprieve. But they had rarely extended Jordan Pickford and anxiety was creeping into their play when VAR bailed out Pawson over the penalty. Luis Díaz tormented the right side of Everton’s defence all afternoon. Young received two bookings for fouls on the Colombia international - the first soft, the second stupid – while it was a Díaz cross that struck Keane’s outstretched arm. Salah’s two goals took him above Kenny Dalglish and Steven Gerrard on the all-time Anfield goalscorers’ list. Young’s dismissal was the 29th in the history of the Merseyside derby. Everton have 20 of them. Their only genuine complaint in this instance was that Kostas Tsimikas, deputising for long-term absentee Andy Robertson, committed an identical foul to Young’s first booking and no card was shown for his foul on Jack Harrison. Their sense of grievance deepened when Konaté escaped a second yellow card for a foul on substitute Beto. James Tarkowski had been booked earlier for a similar trip on Ryan Gravenberch. Klopp essentially acknowledged the let-off for Liverpool when replacing Konaté with Joël Matip at the next available opportunity. Everton were encamped on the back foot with 11 men, although could have taken the lead after 36 seconds when Dominic Calvert-Lewin soared above Virgil van Dijk to meet Dwight McNeil’s delivery. The centre-forward headed straight at Alisson, and the Liverpool keeper was barely troubled again. Liverpool’s final ball was sloppy, perhaps unsurprisingly after the international break, but their difficulties were not entirely of their own making. They faced an obstinate Everton defence that produced increasingly heroic individual displays as the 10 men fought to preserve a point. Tarkowski threw himself in the way of a Salah effort after a rare slip by his hugely impressive partner in central defence, Jarrad Branthwaite. The 21-year-old continues to blossom and show why Everton were so keen to tie him down to a new long-term contract recently. Everton were holding firm when they were undone by VAR. They survived one VAR review when Díaz went down after cutting back inside Nathan Patterson, introduced along with Keane as Dyche switched to a five-man defence for the second half. Barely a minute later there was another for Keane’s failure to move his arm out of the way of Díaz’s cross. Pawson was sent to the pitchside monitor. Salah sent Pickford the wrong way from the spot when the penalty was inevitably awarded. Harvey Elliott, part of an effective double substitution with Darwin Núñez, almost doubled Liverpool’s lead with a 25-yard drive that Pickford tipped on to the bar. The second came with Everton exposed as they went in search of an unlikely equaliser in the dying seconds. The tireless Alexis Mac Allister won possession and sent Núñez scurrying away on the counterattack. Núñez found Salah with a perfectly weighted, perfectly timed pass and an unerring finish ensured Liverpool were home safe."
Arsenal,1,City,0,Gabriel Martinelli snatches statement win for Arsenal over Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/08/arsenal-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-08,"It is what is called getting your substitutions right. As Mikel Arteta luxuriated in his first league win against Manchester City as a manager, one to enhance seriously the title prospects of his Arsenal team, to fortify their belief, he could reflect on how his stars had aligned after a triple change on 76 minutes. For so long, it had looked as though it could be another refereeing story. Nobody knows how this showpiece would have panned out if Mateo Kovacic had been sent off in the 35th minute. But Arsenal would have liked to find out. The City midfielder was a lucky boy. Already booked for a terrible tackle on Martin Ødegaard, Kovacic was playing with fire when he stretched in on Declan Rice to commit a clear foul. Rather than wave a second yellow card, which felt inevitable, the referee, Martin Oliver, allowed Kovacic to stay on. Arsenal rode out the storm. Arteta had sent on the fit-again Gabriel Martinelli at the start of the second half for his first action in three weeks and his mass move was to introduce Thomas Partey (also back to fitness), Takehiro Tomiyasu and Kai Havertz. The trio would link up to create the big chance for Martinelli towards the end and how he took it. Partey played a high diagonal, Tomiyasu headed back, Havertz made the lay-off. And when Martinelli shot, it deflected wickedly off Nathan Aké to sink City. Arsenal had lost their previous 12 games against the champions in this competition. They sorely needed to make a statement. The victory was built on emotional control and concentration out of possession. Arsenal restricted City, especially Erling Haaland, and Martinelli blew a cagey game open to spark delirium; a bit of post-match tunnel aggro, too. The visiting captain, Kyle Walker, appeared to clash with the Arsenal set-piece coach, Nicolas Jover, and some of his City teammates were involved, together with the stewards. Guardiola was asked if he was happy at how Arsenal had behaved. “Yeah, absolutely,” he replied, trademark sarcasm to the fore. City missed Rodri, who was serving the third game of his three-match ban for his red card against Nottingham Forest. They have now lost all three. Guardiola started with Bernardo Silva in front of the back four in a kind of Andrea Pirlo role, except with more running, Rico Lewis and Kovacic the No 8s either side. Silva helped to set a brisk early tone for City, emerging with credit. Arsenal needed time to work things out, especially without the injured Bukayo Saka, who they could not patch up and send out yet again. It was the first time in 88 league games that they did not have him. Arteta said Saka could not play for England for the upcoming internationals. City almost landed the early blow, Josko Gvardiol hooking a corner goalwards from the far post and watching Rice head clear off the line. On the second phase, Haaland flicked on for Aké, who took a touch and lifted high from close range. Liam Brady was the pre-match guest and he was asked how excited he was. “I’m nervous,” the Arsenal legend replied. So were the home crowd, especially when David Raya looked to play out from the back and into City’s high press. The goalkeeper had to show his personality to stick to Arteta’s orders because he made mistakes early on and heard the Arsenal support urge him to play longer and more quickly throughout. Raya had shanked one pass when he dallied close to his line in the 17th minute and was tackled by Julián Álvarez, the ball squirting just wide of the near post. A let-off. City enjoyed theirs with Kovacic and it was an extraordinary one. His booking for clattering into Ødegaard’s ankle was in dark orange territory; the City player was given the benefit of the doubt after a VAR check. But his foul on Rice was a stonewall second yellow. “You don’t know what you’re doing,” the home fans informed Oliver. The tensions simmered, taking in the moment during the interval when Samir Nasri, working here as a media pundit, was aggressively accosted by an Arsenal fan in one of the concourses. What happened? “Just a guy who spoke shit because I left Arsenal,” Nasri replied. The man was ejected from the ground. With Jorginho in midfield, Rice had the licence to push up when Arsenal had possession and he impressed. The individual duels pounded, particularly William Saliba v Haaland. The second half came to feel locked, chances almost non-existent and Guardiola made his move with a triple substitution on 68 minutes that shone a light on Kalvin Phillips’s loneliness on the bench. On came the fit-again John Stones and Matheus Nunes in midfield, plus Jérémy Doku on the wing. It was Arteta’s response that changed everything."
West Ham,2,Newcastle,2,Mohammed Kudus stunner earns West Ham battling draw against Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/08/west-ham-newcastle-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-08,"This was about perseverance. While Newcastle found it impossible to produce the dynamism that tore Paris Saint-Germain to shreds, they displayed character by taking control during the second half and were poised to claim a valuable victory before West Ham rescued a point with a brilliant late equaliser from Mohammed Kudus. In the end there was warm applause for both sides for digging deep and going the distance after draining midweek assignments in Europe. There were flaws on display, though it was hard to be overly critical. If Newcastle were running on empty after their win against PSG, it was hard to tell when they turned the game on its head after half-time. After Tomas Soucek’s opener for West Ham, they went ahead as the impressive Alexander Isak scored twice in five minutes. It seemed there would only be one winner at that stage. No doubt there would have been if Isak had gone on to complete his hat-trick, only to miss an open goal after going through and rounding Alphonse Areola, West Ham’s goalkeeper. That was the turning point. West Ham are nothing if not resilient under David Moyes and, though they were not at their best, they earned their reward when Kudus, on as a substitute, scored his first goal in the Premier League after taking a pass from Vladimir Coufal and drilling in a left-footed shot from 20 yards. There soon followed an inquest into the failings that allowed Kudus to deny Newcastle a win that would have taken them above West Ham and into seventh. There was some irritation at Sandro Tonali, the inconsistent Italy midfielder, failing to stop the Ghana forward from shooting. Questions were also raised over why Kudus was in so much space, plus why Coufal was allowed to advance so far from right-back before finding West Ham’s £37m summer signing. Whoever was to blame, though, the biggest takeaway was that Newcastle need to be more ruthless if they are to return to the Champions League next season. “I’m really disappointed we didn’t get over the line,” was Howe’s verdict. “We’ve made a couple of mistakes and got punished.” It became clear from the outset that Newcastle would not find it easy to summon the intensity that overwhelmed PSG. West Ham, buoyed by beating Freiburg in the Europa League, had complete faith in their suffocating tactics after going ahead with the game’s first noteworthy attack. West Ham’s opener was evidence of their ability to make a lot out of very little. Nothing appeared to be brewing when Michail Antonio darted to the left to beat Jamaal Lascelles to the ball. Newcastle’s mistake, though, was believing it. Their defensive shape unravelled with Lascelles pulled out of the centre and they were slow to react when Lucas Paquetá played a lovely ball over the top after spotting Emerson Palmieri’s surge from left-back. Nick Pope flew off his line and was stranded when Emerson got there first. The Italy international went round Pope and saw support arriving in the six-yard box. Soucek, making the most of being given the freedom to advance from midfield, easily collected his fourth goal in six games. Newcastle, who looked short of natural width without the suspended Anthony Gordon, struggled to regain their composure. Sean Longstaff smashed a pass out of play. Bruno Guimarães was booked for fouling Emerson and should have received a second yellow for tripping James Ward-Prowse. West Ham gave little away, though Newcastle improved as half-time approached. Isak’s dancing feet gave them hope up front, as did Miguel Almirón sending a rasping shot inches wide. Dan Burn also headed just wide. With Guimarães seeing more of the ball in midfield, there was a sense that West Ham would need another goal. It was a concern for Moyes that Jarrod Bowen, who has signed a new seven-year deal, was finding little room on the right. West Ham threatened at the start of the second half, Edson Álvarez heading wide from Ward-Prowse’s corner, but there was more urgency from Newcastle. Areola saved a header from Burn after a cross from Isak. The pressure was growing, as was West Ham’s irritation with the refereeing. They seethed when Paquetá was penalised for a foul, but they failed to switch on when Kieran Trippier delivered the free‑kick. Álvarez’s clearing header fell to Isak, who scored with a powerful shot. The visitors soon led. Trippier’s overlapping runs gave West Ham a problem they could not solve. When Guimarães sprayed a pass out to his flank the right-back had time to volley a cross past Nayef Aguerd and into the path of Isak, who converted from close range. Newcastle looked comfortable but wasted chances to score again and West Ham made them pay when Kudus let fly with his left foot. The mood changed and Newcastle were relieved when Pope pushed away a stinging drive from Bowen in added time."
Wolves,1,Villa,1,Torres rescues Aston Villa and angry Emery as Wolves finish with 10 men,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/08/wolves-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-08,"Perhaps the biggest surprise in this stop-start and spiky affair between Midlands rivals was that it took until the 94th minute for someone to see red. Wolves ended this ill-tempered draw with 10 men after Mario Lemina was sent off for picking up a second yellow card during 12 minutes of stoppage time but held on in a fraught finale against Aston Villa to claim a point. Unai Emery and Gary O’Neil did not shake hands following a flashpoint at the final whistle, the former not content to wait around while his opposite number quizzed the fourth official, Paul Tierney, about why the game ticked past 103 minutes. “My conversation with the fourth official was about eight seconds long so he wouldn’t have had to wait very long,” O’Neil said. “But I understand if he doesn’t want to, no problem. I’ve got no problem with Unai at all.” Ollie Watkins, Ezri Konsa and the Villa substitute Nicolò Zaniolo both went close to finding a winner, Watkins hitting a post with almost the last kick of the game and Zaniolo sidefooting inches wide from a Leon Bailey corner, but ultimately Pau Torres’s first Villa goal cancelled out Hwang Hee-chan’s opener. Wolves earlier missed a chance to regain the lead but the again excellent Pedro Neto was unable to beat Emiliano Martínez after latching on to an arced cross by Sasa Kalajdzic, who himself was guilty of failing to take an inviting chance moments later. The sight of Emery urging calm to anyone who would listen as Tierney indicated four additional first-half minutes felt a touch rich given he had spent almost the entire previous 45 haring around his technical area in fury, going haywire at the most innocuous errors. He was apoplectic when Douglas Luiz sent a careless pass astray and seemed close to combusting when John McGinn, his captain, leathered a shot harmlessly wide. On another occasion the Villa manager gesticulated with Martínez for booting a kick straight at José Sá, the goalkeeper’s opposite number. Then he gestured for a yellow card, asking Tierney why Nélson Semedo, who was later cautioned, escaped a booking for a foul on Lucas Digne. Emery’s attempt to play peacemaker on the verge of half‑time followed a contretemps between Rayan Aït‑Nouri and McGinn, which led to a war of words on the touchline. Suddenly Emery was the one who appeared a picture of serenity. “We are ambitious,” Emery said. “I am demanding of myself and of the players. We lost a little bit of control and we needed to better impose our positions on the pitch. We were giving them a lot of opportunities to keep possession, to get into our box and we were not really controlling the game like we had prepared before. At that moment I was a bit frustrated, upset and trying to push the players to get better.” Perhaps Emery’s irritation stemmed from the reality that Villa’s best players had been nullified by the same three-man defence that shepherded Erling Haaland out of the game when Wolves beat Manchester City little over a week ago. Watkins, who this week signed a new five-year contract, had to feed off scraps and Moussa Diaby, Villa’s record signing, was subdued. Watkins sparked into life 46 seconds into the second half, forcing a fine fingertip save from Sá, but Villa’s busiest player was McGinn, at least on the basis of his pantomime tussle with Craig Dawson at free‑kicks and corners. This was of course a Castore derby: both teams are signed up to the same under-fire kit manufacturer, which received complaints from Villa players about shirts being too clingy. The game was prickly and, as McGinn and Dawson could attest, touchy‑feely at times, too. “It’s a derby and I think we felt it on the pitch,” Emery said. As for the absence of post-match formalities, the Villa manager said of O’Neil: “I was waiting to tell him ‘congratulations’ and I gave my hand and he was speaking with the assistant referee. I left, simply.” Wolves seized the advantage eight minutes into the second half. Neto zoomed to the byline, breezing past Torres and from there he cut the ball back for Hwang, who nipped in front of Konsa to convert expertly from close range. Their lead lasted little more than a minute, Torres making amends by prodding in a clever first-time Watkins cross at the back post. Emery was unmoved in the away dugout, arms folded as Torres pointed to the Villa crest on his chest. Villa’s timely equaliser also arrived as Wolves’ supporters in the Sir Jack Hayward Stand were mocking their neighbours. This was an afternoon when both teams enjoyed their moment in the sun."
Brighton,2,Liverpool,2,Lewis Dunk’s Brighton equaliser settles thrilling contest against Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/08/brighton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-08,"Confusion. Confusion on the pitch and confusion off the pitch. A lot of modern football, especially as practised by managers such as Jürgen Klopp and Roberto De Zerbi, seems to be about, if not controlling confusion, then at least directing it, pushing the confusion into the right areas. But a lot of modern football also involves people staring at screens and realising laws that once seemed to resonate with the rectitude of the ages are slippery and ambiguous. Would Liverpool be affected by the video assistant referee controversy of last week? Would their fury and sense of disillusionment curdle into something self‑destructive? Might it even galvanise them? The truth is it barely seemed to make a difference at all. This was Liverpool as they have been for most of the season, a blend of brilliance and vulnerability that makes them look at times like title contenders while the sense lingers that this cannot be sustained. Five times already this season they have gone behind and come back to win and, until Lewis Dunk turned in Solly March’s free-kick with 12 minutes remaining, it looked very much like being a sixth. Had Ryan Gravenberch not hit the bar from close range eight minutes into the second half, it surely would have been. That speaks well of their resilience and character, and rather less well of their defensive capabilities. Was it a fair result? “Unfortunately, yes,” Klopp said. “Because we didn’t score the third we kept the game open. It was intense for both teams. I think the right result.” Brighton have been just as mercurial this season, thrilling yet open, never more than a couple of seconds from scoring, never more than a couple of seconds from conceding. A euphoric feel pervades the Amex, a sense that they cannot quite believe their elevation to the European stage. But three games without a win before Sunday had made clear the strain. De Zerbi has never been afraid of juggling his resources, but six changes from the side that drew in Marseille on Thursday took the sum of his changes over the past six games to 36. He said: “Brighton played with personality, with courage, with a clear idea and a lot of young players. It’s a great result when you don’t lose to Liverpool but I think we deserved the points more.” This was a game defined by pressing and by both sides conceding possession in trying to pass out from the back. Brighton, who seemed in control for most of the first half, went ahead as Simon Adingra intercepted Virgil van Dijk’s ball to Alexis Mac Allister and rolled the ball in from 30 yards as Alisson, who had squared the ball to Van Dijk, failed to get back. It was a goal born of Brighton’s press, of the alertness and composure of Adingra, of poor pass selection and a lack of awareness. But it was also born of Brighton’s almost impeccable recruitment, identifying the Ivorian’s potential after a season in the Danish league with Nordsjælland. The 21-year-old very nearly got a second soon after half-time, sweeping inside Andy Robertson before being denied by a remarkable save from Alisson, who somehow reached behind him to claw away the goal-bound shot. Impressive as Brighton have been this season, they began the game having conceded more than anybody outside the bottom four. Theirs is a high-risk way of playing, but there is also a self-destructiveness about them; when Dunk’s pass was intercepted by Mac Allister, five minutes before half-time, they were exposed. Mohamed Salah took advantage. After two goals that stemmed from turnovers came a third. This time it was Bart Verbruggen, the Brighton keeper, at fault as he played the ball to Pascal Gross under pressure. As Gross was dispossessed, he grabbed at Dominik Szoboszlai’s collar, hauling him down, the ball breaking for Luis Díaz, who was tripped. The penalty was given after the second offence, although the VAR check was apparently for the former; Gross seemed very fortunate to escape a red card. The offence, apparently, was not deemed to be preventing a goalscoring opportunity as Szoboszlai was not moving towards goal, but that seems an extremely generous interpretation given he was one pace from getting off his shot. Klopp made clear what he thought but was guarded in his language: “I’m too old for this kind of thing,” he said. Either way, Salah slammed in the penalty. But handball, of course, is the real mess. When Kaoru Mitoma’s shot flicked off Van Dijk’s thigh on to his arm, De Zerbi was enraged enough to be booked. Van Dijk was probably close enough, his arm unraised enough, that it was not a foul but, frankly, who knows anything any more? Confusion is everywhere. All that is certain is an exhausting game ended level and, for Liverpool, well as they played, even as the game was, such are modern standards in the title race that a draw feels like two points dropped."
Palace,0,Forest,0,Depleted Crystal Palace keep Nottingham Forest out to earn point,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/07/crystal-palace-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-07,"There was a moment during the first half when Roy Hodgson – taking charge of his 400th Premier League match – stood on the touchline simply shaking his head. The Crystal Palace manager had just seen yet another of his players succumb to an injury after a week in which three more, including Eberechi Eze, were ruled out of this meeting with Nottingham Forest. But while it was Steve Cooper’s visitors who created the better chances and could have taken all three points had a brilliant lob from Morgan Gibbs-White not come back off a post, you can always rely on teams managed by Hodgson to keep fighting. The result was a second successive home stalemate and three clean sheets in a row, although new problems for the midfielders Jeffrey Schlupp and Jaïro Riedewald, both of whom had to be substituted, did not go down well with their manager. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like it,” Hodgson said. “But in the circumstances, I’m satisfied with the point – the team was very resilient it was the kind of game that would have been easy to lose.” Forest, who enjoyed a rare away victory on their last visit to London against Chelsea last month, had to make do without their main source of goals after Taiwo Awoniyi picked up a groin injury that Cooper confirmed before kick-off could keep the Nigeria striker out for a month. Awoniyi was badly missed but Gibbs-White’s would-be goal of the season contendereffort and then a mesmerising run from the Brazilian defender Murillo that would have been a goal of the season contender almost provided the inspiration they were looking for. “That will catch the attention of course,” Cooper said. “I wish he scored, but maybe that is next. He is a talent, we won’t get carried away with him but he will help the team grow.” The extent of Palace’s injury problems had been laid bare on Friday when Hodgson arrived at the pre-match press conference with an A4 piece of paper listing all of his unavailable players. But after the news that Cheick Doucouré had joined the chief creators, Eze and Michael Olise, in being sidelined by a hamstring injury, at least the top scorer, Odsonne Édouard, was back to lead the line with Riedewald handed his first Premier League start in more than two years. Riedewald, a Netherlands international signed during Frank de Boer’s brief tenure, has made a little over 30 Premier League starts in seven seasons in south London but was a steadying presence in midfield before his forced withdrawal. A thunderbolt from Harry Toffolo, also making his first league start of the season, produced the first notable moment after 15 minutes as Sam Johnstone was called into action. The Palace goalkeeper looked in trouble when Gibbs-White raced on to a brilliant long ball from Murillo and executed the lob almost perfectly, only for the ball to bounce back into Johnstone’s grateful arms. Any relief Hodgson may have felt was short-lived, however, when Schlupp was forced off midway through the half by injury and the exasperated former England manager kicked the ground in frustration. A Jordan Ayew volley that sailed way over the crossbar did not do much to improve his mood, although a couple of promising runs from Schlupp’s replacement, Jesurun Rak-Sakyi, at least gave the home fans something to get excited about before Toffolo blocked the 21-year-old’s goalbound volley. Murillo’s big moment left Marc Guéhi on his backside courtesy of a brilliant stepover after the 21-year-old had already beaten three players but Johnstone was equal to his shot. Palace then needed Guéhi to block the substitute Gonzalo Montiel’s effort at the back post after he had been picked out by Toffolo’s cross before Murillo headed over from the resulting corner. Jean-Philippe Mateta was then inches away from breaking the deadlock after a lovely move from Palace was started by Tyrick Mitchell but the striker could not provide the finish. It needed an excellent block from Joachim Andersen to deny Montiel with a long-range volley. Meanwhile, Palace huffed and puffed but could not create another clearcut opportunity to banish their injury blues."
Fulham,3,Sheffield,1,Basham injury mars match as Fulham inflict more misery on Sheffield United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/07/fulham-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-07,"At times like this it is hard for any football fan not to feel a pang of sympathy for Paul Heckingbottom. With each passing week, the size of the rock the Sheffield United manager must push up this Premier League mountain seems to grow exponentially. At almost no point here did his side give any indication they have the required quality to remain in the top tier, despite coming up against a Fulham team that, for much of the season, has appeared implacably opposed to scoring. In addition to the misery of losing seven of their eight league games, the visitors had the misfortune of seeing Chris Basham depart for what is certain to be a long period out. He suffered the type of horrific suspected broken ankle that should ensure any slow-motion replays of the awful incident carry an 18 rating. “You’re going down,” sang the Fulham fans, and it is hard to see how they will not be proved correct. Even when Sheffield United did haul themselves into proceedings – dealt a slice of luck when the Fulham centre-back Issa Diop was struck by a leg injury and gifted them possession that resulted in a goal – the visitors’ misfortune soon continued, with Fulham regaining their lead through a freak Wes Foderingham own goal. At some point it may be fairer to relieve Heckingbottom of his duties purely as an act of mercy. Sheffield United’s only real period of respite came during the lengthy stoppage for Basham’s injury midway through the opening half. Attempting a cross high up the pitch, the veteran defender’s leg seemed to give way, leaving his foot dangling at a horrendous angle after suffering what looked to be a serious break. A 13-minute delay followed, while both teams’ medical staff tended to the Sheffield United captain, who received oxygen on the pitch and was taken away on a stretcher and straight into a waiting ambulance. Basham raised his hand in recognition of the heartfelt applause ringing out from all inside the ground as he departed. “He’s where he needs to be, in hospital with the doctors,” said Heckingbottom. “No one wants to see that ever. It’s terrible, horrific.” Of his side’s plight, propping up the table with one point, he said: “You get what you deserve and we’re where we deserve to be. “At the minute the things that can go against us are going against us. But we have to roll with it. It’s only us that can get ourselves out of it.” Victory came as a huge relief for Marco Silva who, for much of the game, must have wondered what he could possibly do to convince his team to put the ball in the net. With Fulham’s joint league-low tally (alongside Sheffield United and Bournemouth) of five goals scored heading into this game, Silva made three attacking changes for the match only to see his side waste multiple chances until Bobby De Cordova-Reid broke the deadlock on 53 minutes, slotting assuredly past Bernd Leno. Diop’s injury occurred when he was serenely carrying the ball forward, causing him to tumble to the ground and handing possession to James McAtee. He passed out wide to fellow substitute Yasser Larouci, whose cross was turned into his own net by Antonee Robinson. On Diop’s injury, Silva said: “A crack in his foot. It doesn’t look good.” Parity did not last long. When Tom Cairney slipped shooting from 25 yards out, the ball looped awkwardly high into the air and off the crossbar, where it rebounded against Foderingham’s back and into the goal. Willian then wrapped up victory when he drove home strongly from just inside the penalty area. “A well-deserved three points and an important win for us,” said Silva. “We started to create from the first moment. When you create so many chances the normal thing is to put the ball in the net. But the players believed and kept to the plan.”"
Everton,3,Bournemouth,0,Doucouré strike seals emphatic victory for Everton against Bournemouth,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/07/everton-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-07,"The sun shone like the first day of a bright new season, Everton scored for fun and won handsomely on home soil. A strange day indeed, but one Sean Dyche desperately needed and Goodison Park craved having endured torment for far too long. A first home victory of the campaign, at the fifth attempt, and three goals at Goodison for the first time in almost a year signified a rare uplifting and entertaining afternoon for Everton. They had not scored more than once in a home game since beating Crystal Palace 3-0 last October – 18 Premier League games ago - but James Garner, Jack Harrison and Abdoulaye Doucouré ended that sorry sequence in a commanding display. The spotlight switches to Bournemouth’s winless run under Andoni Iraola, with questions already being asked about their new manager’s future. “You talk about me having a good reputation but I have to show it,” Iraola admitted. “We haven’t won any (Premier League) games so that means I am not doing my homework, but I feel the players are pushing and will improve.” His Bournemouth team were anemic at both ends of the pitch and compliant visitors for an Everton team seeking home improvement. Having lost their opening four league games at Goodison for the first time since 1958, the pressure was on Everton not simply to win but to rekindle confidence in Dyche’s approach. The process was helped by the gift of an early lead. Illia Zabarnyi was the unfortunate culprit, losing his footing when bringing the ball out of defence. Garner seized on the loose ball, strode forward with intent and swept a low shot beyond goalkeeper Neto from the edge of the area. Tension lifted off Everton and confidence, that precious commodity, took its place. “The key was 1-0,” said Iraola. “It gives them a lift and the way it happened meant we felt unsafe playing from the back.” The overdue return of Garner to central midfield alongside Amadou Onana brought greater composure and creativity to Everton’s play. Their pressing game improved too. The partnership was forced on Dyche after Idrissa Gana Gueye suffered a heel injury in the warm-up, prompting Onana’s late promotion from the bench. Everton doubled their lead in spectacular style when Harrison, who was carrying a hamstring problem, marked his first home start with a beautiful debut goal. Neto punched a Harrison cross straight to Vitalii Mykolenko, then punched the Ukrainian left-back’s return ball under pressure to the on-loan winger from Leeds. Harrison, 25 yards out, floated an inch-perfect half-volley back over the stranded keeper and in off the underside of the bar. A glorious way to well and truly lift the Goodison gloom. Everton could have been further ahead by the interval. Dominic Calvert-Lewin headed an inviting Ashley Young cross against the bar and Onana fired wide following a flowing move. Zabarnyi almost gifted the hosts another goal when putting Doucouré through with a slack back pass. The midfielder, who saved Everton’s Premier League status with the winner against Bournemouth last season fired tamely at Neto, but didn’t wait long to atone. Doucouré released Dwight McNeil to the byline after Onana dispossessed Adam Smith. McNeil’s floated cross to the back post was met by Harrison, whose header was blocked on the line by Milos Kerkez. The loose ball fell kindly for Doucouré to crash home from close range. The hosts were rampant with Doucouré and the tireless duo of Calvert-Lewin and McNeil all going close to a fourth. “There were so many good performances and I’m really pleased for the group,” the Everton manager said. “The difference is when we win the noise changes. If you don’t win people lose faith in good performances. We had 25 efforts today, 23 in the last game. Today we didn’t wait for it to happen, we stepped up and made it happen and that has to be a mindset that continues.”"
United,2,Brentford,1,Manchester United sink Brentford with McTominay’s injury-time double,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/07/manchester-united-brentford-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-07,"Scott McTominay and Harry Maguire: two unlikely heroes to rescue Manchester United from the nadir of bridging a 44-year gap to the last time England’s record 20-times champions suffered three successive league defeats at Old Trafford. That was where Erik ten Hag’s desperate side were heading deep in added time, as Brentford led 1-0. Then Alejandro Garnacho twisted and turned along the left and fired the ball in, it ricocheted about and came to McTominay, who lashed home to the relief of all of a United persuasion. This was part one of the great comeback. For part two, enter Maguire. Like McTominay, he was for sale in the summer window, before each remained due to there being no buyers for the former captain or the academy-reared midfielder. A right-to-left diagonal free-kick was punted into the area by Bruno Fernandes and up rose Maguire with a sweetly executed header to McTominay, who nodded in for a winner that sent him, his teammates, Ten Hag and the place ballistic. The Scot had come on in the 88th minute. McTominay was excited to score in what was known as “Fergie-time” under Sir Alex Ferguson, the garlanded former United manager who retired in May 2013. “I was watching [David] Beckham’s documentary and he [Sir Alex] was always looking at his watch like that,” he said. “It just shows today you can score a last-minute winner.” Until the equaliser Brentford had led through Mathias Jensen’s 26th-minute opener, the result of the kind of calamitous play that has plagued United’s campaign. Near the centre circle, the sloppy Casemiro gave the ball away to Bryan Mbuemo. Brentford skipped downfield, Victor Lindelöf failed to clear, Casemiro still slumbered and when Yoane Wissa found Jensen his shot went under the hapless André Onana’s right hand. After McTominay’s 97th-minute goal, Andrew Madley, the referee, blew for time almost instantly and the midfielder’s expression was an adrenaline-flushed picture of bliss – and disbelief, because while United never gave up they had been so disjointed that the afternoon seemed certain to close in more pain. Trailing at 92min 46sec, this was the latest United had been behind in a Premier League game they have gone on to win, but serious issues remain for Ten Hag. Onana, the new No 1, is proving a liability, in midfield Casemiro seems to have aged a decade from last season and further forward Mason Mount and Marcus Rashford are phantoms floating about unable to affect fortunes. Ten Hag’s management, too, is buckling. After more than a year in charge, where is the high press or the brand of progressive football? The most positive the Dutchman can be at the moment is when he points to the mentality that can pull a match such as this from the fire, as he did afterwards. Ten Hag had appeared out of luck, too, when having to select Maguire, whom he discarded as captain, alongside Jonny Evans, whose first spell at the club began when signing professional forms for Ferguson in July 2006. When Raphaël Varane went down with a minor problem the manager had to shift Victor Lindelöf to left-back to accommodate the Maguire-Evans defensive axis, the latter having enjoyed a last start in home colours in this stadium in spring 2015, under Louis van Gaal, when Sunderland were beaten 2-0. When Christian Eriksen jogged on for the second half for Casemiro the hope was that the Dane could transform the contest but it was the two later substitutes, Garnacho and McTominay (especially), who did the business. McTominay said: “That might be one of my favourite moments on a football pitch. Two goals at the death was incredible, but I am just happy to be able to contribute and show people that I can do it. “It’s hard to put into words because I’ve been at Man United since I was five years old, for me this club means everything.” Old Trafford had been a cauldron when he was sent on. “It was very loud, the fans were roaring us on so I couldn’t hear fully [Ten Hag]. He probably said something like: ‘Go on and score,’ which is what I did.”"
Burnley,1,Chelsea,4,Sterling bounces back from England snub to lead Chelsea’s rout of Burnley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/07/burnley-chelsea-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-07,"There’s little doubt Raheem Sterling had recent snubs from Mauricio Pochettino and Gareth Southgate in the back of his mind when he arrived at Turf Moor, despite his half-hearted protestations to the contrary. The Chelsea head coach suggested as much after watching Sterling inspire an impressive fightback, as his side battered the Burnley defence to cruise to a second league away win in five days. The one-time England talisman was electric down the Chelsea left, setting up the first two goals before scoring the third himself. He even had a hand in Nicolas Jackson’s fourth. “I wouldn’t say I had something to prove,” Sterling told the TV cameras. But his manager was sufficiently impressed after leaving the 28-year-old on the bench for Monday’s win at Fulham and last week’s home victory over Brighton in the Carabao Cup. “It’s his job to play well,” said Pochettino. “He knows he needs to perform and to show the manager of the national team that he was wrong with his decision.” Finally, Chelsea are harnessing a sense of healthy competition in their star-studded squad. Most observers would say it’s about time, given the £1bn transfer spend in the 17 months since Todd Boehly acquired the club. It’s easy to forget that Sterling was a £47.5m purchase in the nascent days of the brave new era – and his return of 11 goals in 47 appearances so far comes in significantly below par. But in this kind of form, responding to his recent omission from the England squad with a clear statement to Southgate, he’s a precious diamond for club and country. Wilson Odobert had threatened to ruin another Chelsea away day with a goal inside the first 15 minutes, before Sterling made the afternoon his own. It’s a luxury for Pochettino that he can bring a four-time Premier League winner into his starting lineup. In Sterling, the Argentinian had this game’s trump card: a proven winner with an elite mentality who has now wrestled back his place on the left after Mykhailo Mudryk stepped into the void to score at Fulham. “Always in football it’s about performance and the players need to feel that they deserve to play,” said Pochettino. “If we want to fight for big things, we need to be consistent in every game and that comes from competition between the players. With time, with all the players fit, there’s going to be massive competition and that is good for the team.” Sterling was often a lone crusader in the first half, the only one in blue who looked likely to storm Vincent Kompany’s castle. When the equaliser came just before half-time, it was inevitable Sterling would have a say. He raided up the left and his cross cannoned off Ameen Al-Dakhil, ballooned over James Trafford and nestled neatly in the net. From thereon, Chelsea took control. Sterling was tripped (just) inside the box by the beleaguered right-back Vitinho. Once VAR had done its check, the ice-cold Cole Palmer rolled the penalty past Trafford. The quality on offer to Pochettino was always going to be key and, when his side clicked, a chasm opened between the teams. Sterling deservedly etched his name on to the scoresheet after 65 minutes, as a cheap concession in the Burnley midfield resulted in Moisés Caicedo releasing Conor Gallagher, who played in Sterling. In this mood, he was simply never going to miss. “He’s a top player,” said Kompany, a Manchester City teammate of Sterling for four years. “It goes to show what this league is about. You play well for one half but it’s not enough. They’ve got wingers who, in one v one situations, are able to create something. They’re a top team, the fact that results haven’t come for them initially doesn’t change that.” One suspects on this evidence that the results could keep coming for Pochettino. This was Chelsea’s greatest margin of victory since April 2022; it was the first time they’d clinched three successive wins since March this year – and they hadn’t won a game after conceding first in 19 previous attempts. They are breaking down barriers. With Sterling in this form and with competition for places to intensify when players such as Christopher Nkunku and Roméo Lavia return, rivals: beware."
Luton,0,Spurs,1,Van de Ven seals victory at Luton to take 10-man Tottenham top of the table,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/07/luton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-07,"Another happy day for Ange Postecoglou, though his team reached the Premier League summit the hard way. When Yves Bissouma was dismissed for a second bookable offence on the stroke of half-time for a clear dive over Mads Andersen, an action that would fail to confuse even the most befuddled Stockley Park VAR official, there was adversity for the new Tottenham to face down. “A lot of character, a lot of resilience,” was what the Australian put victory down as a best start to the season since 1960 continues. “You get the red card and it’s a different type of game. We handled it really well, stayed calm and composed.” The inspiration of James Maddison in setting up Micky van de Ven’s goal from a short corner was enough for victory over a Luton team who chased hard, only for their lack of cutting edge to betray them. The three points Tottenham escaped with might have come far easier. They had begun with purpose if not precision, Richarlison guilty of misreading a Dejan Kulusevski cross to start a series of spurned opportunities. Rob Edwards’ slim hopes of his team’s survival rely on making the most of chances and, equally, not presenting opponents with chances. “I feel like we have left points out there today,” the manager said. There were early home groans when their striker Carlton Morris, having found space, could not find Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu with his layoff. It was to set a template but Luton played their way back in. A couple of Chiedozie Ogbene’s bursts past Pedro Porro further raised hopes among the home faithful. As the first half drew on, their team was growing into the contest. A previous Tottenham stroll was becoming rather more uncomfortable. There were still chances on offer, with Kulusevski forcing a good save from Thomas Kaminski. Maddison was meanwhile coming in for heavy treatment from Luton players and fans alike but revelled in the dual role of pariah and Tottenham main man. Bissouma’s fifth booking of the season for a clear foul on Ogbene, his first, would eventually prove fateful. Officialdom was on Spurs’ side when Tom Lockyer bundled home following a goalmouth scramble. VAR ruled – correctly – that Elijah Adebayo had clattered into Cristian Romero during a stramash that left the penalty box strewn with bodies. Then came Bissouma’s long walk to the dressing room. “He’s been brilliant for us,” said a sympathetic Postecoglou. “Our reaction was outstanding.” Half-time allowed time to regroup. Pierre-Emile Højbjerg replaced Richarlison but Spurs did not look especially secure. Adebayo had a glorious 47th-minute chance that looked unmissable and yet squirted behind to silence aghast home fans. “A big, big, big chance,” said a wincing Edwards. “We’ve been punished for it. We’re saying the same things at the moment.” Similar quiet would descend after Maddison weaved through Luton’s defenders, wizardry in the fashion of a Gascoigne, a Ginola, a Hoddle, to lay up Van de Ven. As Luton waited for the restart, Tottenham’s latest maverick idled to the halfway line, a smirk on his face. Spurs players are free to savour the fun times in a fashion unthinkable during the histrionics of Antonio Conte’s regime. “The players want to change the destiny of this football club,” said their indulgent new manager. After his first goal for the club, Van de Ven said: “We have a great mentality and motivation as a team and we need to keep going in this way.” Not that Tottenham weren’t made to suffer for their smiles. Luton threw a Bedfordshire kitchen sink at the task. Within a frenzy of efforts on Spurs’ goal, Alfie Doughty volleyed wide, Guglielmo Vicario made a close-range save from Morris, Jacob Brown headed wide before Cauley Woodrow shot straight at the goalkeeper. Postecoglou, ever the gambler, removed Maddison and Son Heung-min with 15 minutes left, Oliver Skipp and Emerson Royal’s arrival his attempt to lock things down. It paid off. Spurs grew in assurance as Luton sagged to an exhausted, beaten standstill."
Luton,1,Burnley,2,Jacob Bruun Larsen sinks Luton to give Burnley first win of season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/03/luton-burnley-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-03,"After spending much of the second half trying to repel an aerial barrage from Luton Town, it seemed unlikely that Burnley would have anything left when their resistance broke in the 84th minute. What happened next was proof resilience is not only about crunching tackles and clearing headers. Jacob Bruun Larsen showed that technique also matters. Before half-time the story was of Burnley outmanoeuvring Luton and going ahead with a lovely goal from Lyle Foster. Vincent Kompany was edging the tactical battle but Rob Edwards responded. Luton were hoping to go three unbeaten and were on course to stay clear of another of the promoted sides when Elijah Adebayo equalised. As Kenilworth Road erupted few imagined the joy would be so short-lived. “We’re flat and hurting,” Edwards said, trying to make sense of parity lasting all of 65 seconds before Bruun Larsen brilliantly restored Burnley’s lead. “We adjusted well in the second half. We had 15 shots inside the box and only scored one. That’s the hardest bit in football: to score a goal.” Larsen offered a demonstration of how to do it after coming off the bench. The twist arrived when he cut in from the right, moved on to his left foot and bent a beautiful shot beyond Thomas Kaminski from 20 yards. Luton, guilty of allowing their focus to drop, were shattered. Burnley, who remain in the bottom three on goal difference, had their first league win in seven games this season. For Kompany, the hope will be it gives them the belief they can stay up. “It had been coming,” Burnley’s manager said. “It was a very complete performance in the first half. The second half had to be a battle. For those who followed us in the Championship, you know we enjoy these type of games. I’ll never shy away from a battle.” The sight of Carlton Morris and Chiedozie Ogbene tearing forward to close down Burnley’s goalkeeper, James Trafford, after five seconds was an early signal of Luton’s determination to build on their win over Everton. Once the game settled down, though, Burnley took charge. Josh Brownhill, Sander Berge and Josh Cullen controlled midfield. Luton were fortunate not to go behind when Brownhill’s corner found Ameen Al-Dakhil. Kaminski did well to push the defender’s header over. Burnley went close again when Brownhill whipped a shot over from 25 yards, then when Zeki Amdouni fired wide. Luton, who had to bring Reece Burke on for the injured Amari’i Bell, craved such finesse. Their best moments came from wide deliveries, Ogbene and Jacob Brown both glancing wide. Yet the concern for Edwards was how Burnley were outnumbering Marvelous Nakamba and Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu in the middle. At a tactical disadvantage, Luton’s inability to respond cost them when Berge released Foster after escaping Mpanzu. Onside and free of Tom Lockyer, Foster ran clear to slide a low shot past Kaminski. Luton improved in the second half. Adebayo’s introduction allowed them to switch from a 3-4-2-1 system to 4-4-2 and the equaliser almost arrived moments later. Brown headed goalwards and Cullen somehow cleared off the line. Burnley fell back, almost conceding a penalty when Jordan Beyer challenged Morris, and Luton refused to stop. The reward arrived when Adebayo, collecting Burke’s header from Tahith Chong’s deep cross, turned and fired past Trafford. Bruun Larsen would have the final say."
Fulham,0,Chelsea,2,Mykhailo Mudryk off the mark as Chelsea dazzle Fulham in 80 seconds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/02/fulham-chelsea-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-02,"The recovery may be at an early stage, but the sight of a rampant Mykhailo Mudryk tearing through to score his first goal in English football, Armando Broja finding the net on his first start since recovering from a serious knee injury and Cole Palmer’s delicate passing bewitching Fulham’s defenders will only strengthen Chelsea’s belief in Mauricio Pochettino’s ability to coax the best out of their young talents. This is an ambitious project, one dependent on how quickly a squad packed with inexperience can develop, and this could have been another difficult night for Pochettino. Fulham would have loved to have more fun at Chelsea’s expense. They must have had visions of João Palhinha dominating Moisés Caicedo and Willian running riot against his former employers. Instead, Chelsea were in charge from the start, their football crisp and inventive, individuals winning their battles in every area. They displayed many of the best traits of a Pochettino side, their aggressive mindset allowing their creators to shine, and will feel there is more to come after moving up to 11th place with their first league win in over a month. For Pochettino, there was proof that commitment will always pay off. Chelsea’s head coach has taken a special interest in Mudryk, working on the winger’s confidence, bonding with him on the training ground, and the Ukrainian has grown in recent weeks. Here, despite opening with a couple of erratic moments, Mudryk soared. After enduring such mockery since his £88.5m move from Shakhtar Donetsk in January, he stopped running down dead ends, exploded into life after 18 minutes and smashed his shot past Bernd Leno after controlling Levi Colwill’s flighted cross. The only disappointment for Pochettino was a minor thigh injury forcing Mudryk off at half-time. Caicedo also departed late on with a sore knee, lengthening Chelsea’s injury list, though the visitors had the points in the bag by that stage. Settled by Mudryk’s opener, they followed it with another 80 seconds later, Broja marking a bulldozing centre-forward’s display by punishing more diffident defending from Fulham when he linked with Palmer and scored for the first time since suffering a cruciate ligament injury last December. All along the insistence from Chelsea has been about the data pointing towards a team moving in the right direction. If the results have not matched performances, though, perhaps that is only natural from a club who brought in so much youth. Chelsea have been naive at times and their struggles cannot only be explained by their goalscoring issues. Pochettino had also looked to infuse his team with more knowhow before this London derby. Straight away came the sight of Caicedo setting the tone in defensive midfield, leaving two early reducers on Andreas Pereira, and Broja’s physicality causing problems for Fulham. It was as if Chelsea were powered by a determination to silence the taunts about last season’s plummet to third best in west London. The worry for Pochettino, of course, was that Chelsea would rue not going ahead during a dominant opening spell. A sense of foreboding fell over the visitors when a loose touch from Palhinha sent Broja through in the second minute and the striker blazed high and wide after rounding Leno. Enzo Fernández also wasted a promising opening with a heavy touch, before two attacks faltered at Mudryk’s feet. Yet Chelsea kept finding space behind Palhinha and Harrison Reed, Fulham’s midfielders. They varied their passing angles and attacked again when Caicedo switched the play to the left. Colwill had room to attack and Issa Diop misjudged the left-back’s ball, allowing Mudryk to storm through, control and give Chelsea a deserved lead. Fulham could not escape the traps being set by Pochettino. The ball went back to Tim Ream from the restart and the centre-back gave it straight to Palmer. Chelsea were making mistakes happen. Palmer, justifying his inclusion ahead of Raheem Sterling with an array of clever touches on the right, found Broja and a comedy of errors ended when Ream’s challenge rebounded off the 22-year-old and into the net. It was unintentional, but Broja had made his own luck after replacing the suspended Nicolas Jackson. His ability to run the channels made life tough for Fulham and created space for others in blue. Fernández was in his element in an advanced position, almost scoring from 20 yards. Caicedo ran midfield. Conor Gallagher offered energy and intelligence in the middle. Palmer continues to look a smart signing from Manchester City. Pochettino also enjoyed the hunger of Marc Cucurella, once again filling in at right-back. Fulham were lightweight in attack, though they improved in the second half. Carlos Vinícius headed over after coming off the bench and Robert Sánchez denied another substitute, Sasa Lukic. Yet Chelsea could point to Ian Maatsen hitting the post after replacing Mudryk. They dug deep, Thiago Silva and Axel Disasi protecting Sánchez’s goal. Perhaps they are growing up."
Forest,1,Brentford,1,Forest’s 10 men hold on against Brentford as Domínguez claims point,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/01/nottingham-forest-brentford-premier-league-match-report,2023-10-01,"Neither Steve Cooper nor Thomas Frank were happy with the match officials after this draw. The former – Nottingham Forest’s manager – felt his team should not have been reduced to 10 men and the other was upset that his side were not awarded a penalty, to ramp up the pressure on referees after failings on Saturday. Moussa Niakhaté kicked off nine minutes of drama on an otherwise sedate occasion when he was given a second yellow card for raking his studs down Yoane Wissa’s calf. This was soon followed by Christian Nørgaard and Nico Domínguez exchanging headed goals to ensure a fair draw. Wissa was earlier at the heart of another controversial moment when he was brought down in the box after dispossessing goalkeeper Matt Turner but nothing was given on the pitch nor by the video referees. There were also two potential handball offences by Forest in the first half which were waved away. “I am tired of talking about it [VAR],” Frank, Brentford’s manager, said. “I think the two handballs, some managers will claim them as penalties but if they were given against my team, I’d be annoyed. I think the Wissa one is a clear penalty, you can’t go through the back. That is an error from VAR – it is clear and obvious. Maybe our players need to be a bit more nasty [with officials].” For 52 minutes, prior to Wissa and Turner’s clash, anyone in attendance could have been forgiven for thinking they had arrived for an end-of-season clash with nothing on the line for either team. It took until first-half injury time for either goalkeeper to be forced into a save after a flat start amid a constant downpour. Niakhaté’s first bookable challenge was reckless on Mathias Jensen, taking him out on the left flank and the back of Wissa’s leg will testify to the second. The defender’s dismissal was followed by Nørgaard flicking home, via Turner’s hands, Jensen’s perfectly weighted cross from the resulting free-kick. “If he doesn’t give him a second yellow, nobody mentions it,” Cooper said. “With it being the only Premier League game of the day, PGMOL needed a really clean day and they got the opposite. We want to help referees – we will moan and complain as much as anyone else, we will do it respectfully but sometimes it’s hard. They’ve got to help themselves. I am annoyed with the first yellow, he shouldn’t have lunged in, it is the right decision. The second yellow, it would have not been mentioned if he had just given a free-kick. You need football understanding to know that [it was accidental]. It is a contact game.” Minus a player and down a goal, Forest could have been forgiven for taking time to compose themselves. Substitutions were quickly made to reorganise a side one short in defence, bringing on Harry Toffolo for his first Premier League minutes of the season. Rather than being rusty, he sent in his own pinpoint cross for Domínguez to loop over Mark Flekken, which Frank described as a “freak goal”, although less generous critics might question the goalkeeper’s positioning. Despite having a man fewer for 46 minutes, thanks to lengthy second-half stoppage time, Forest ended the match with two strikers on the pitch as they felt they could steal a win at a raucous City Ground. Neither Chris Wood nor Divock Origi could be the hero; instead they had the 21-year-old debutant Murillo to thank, as he stepped behind Turner to repel Michael Olakigbe’s added-time shot that beat the goalkeeper but not the Brazilian, who impressed on his first outing in red. Forest had enjoyed the better of the first quarter of the match, with Ibrahim Sangaré giving a greater indication why Cooper has spent two seasons chasing the midfielder. He looked composed, skilful and his physical presence saw opponents bounce off him when required. His efforts alongside Domínguez and Orel Mangala explained why Morgan Gibbs-White was left out as the manager looked to control midfield. Taiwo Awoniyi had a goal rightly chalked off for offside but the only meaningful action of the first half was Niakhaté’s booking. Thankfully, the second brought some action to appease the spectators. Forest will be pleased that their new signings are settling quicker than last season and Brentford can at least point to ending their run of defeats, even if they have not won in five Premier League matches."
Spurs,2,Liverpool,1,Joël Matip own goal gives Tottenham dramatic win over nine-man Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/30/tottenham-liverpool-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-30,"It was a pulsating spectacle from start to finish and it is perhaps better to focus on the finish, despite everything that had gone before – the goals for either team, the one that was not and the two red cards for Liverpool. Curtis Jones was the first to depart for a late tackle on Yves Bissouma midway through the first half, a challenge that looked honest enough but increasingly bad on the replays, and Diogo Jota followed him on 69 minutes. On as a half-time substitute for Cody Gakpo, who was injured by a Destiny Udogie challenge and then aggravated the problem in the act of equalising for Liverpool, Jota let his team down. The first booking, for a very slight trip on Udogie, was soft. But having received it, he was playing with fire just 87 seconds later when he stretched into a tackle on the same Tottenham player. It was only going to end one way for him when he did not get the ball. Jürgen Klopp had been hailed as one of the great innovators of the modern English game by the Spurs manager, Ange Postecoglou, on Friday. But has he ever set up in a 5-3-0 formation to try to preserve a point? Spurs had camped inside the Liverpool half from the start of the second period and, after Jota’s dismissal, they sought to turn the screw some more. And yet the crazy thing was that Klopp’s nine men barely gave up a chance. It looked set to be one of the great backs-to-the-wall efforts. There was a bigger twist in store, the result slipping away from Liverpool in the final minute of the six added to stoke grave feelings of injustice. Postecoglou showed his frustration when Dejan Kulusevski went back to Cristian Romero from the right wing. Spurs had to attack. But Romero swiftly worked it back out to Pedro Porro and, when he drove in a cross, Joël Matip swung a boot. The defender’s body shape was wrong; maybe it was fatigue? Instead of clearing, he sent the ball careering into the top of his own net. As against Sheffield United in the previous game here, Spurs snatched victory at the very last. Once again the place went wild, the natives united in delirium and then acknowledgment of the revolution being wrought by Postecoglou. They are certainly loving Big Ange instead. For Liverpool, it was brutally harsh, particularly after what had happened in the 34th minute at 0-0. Luis Díaz looked onside when he burst clear of Porro to finish brilliantly only for the flag to go up. It felt as though the VAR would intervene to overrule the on-field decision and yet it did not. A human error, the PGMOL later said. So Klopp and his players could console themselves with that. Liverpool missed the chance to capitalise on Manchester City’s defeat at Wolves from earlier in the day while Spurs simply cavorted up above them and into second place. They remain unbeaten, everything going their way. Klopp had started Gakpo ahead of Darwin Núñez and it felt like a long time ago that the centre-forward was narrowly failing to put a different complexion on the game in the early running. When he spun and shot after an Andy Robertson cut-back, Guglielmo Vicario made a reaction save. When Robertson banged the rebound goalwards, Vicario saved again. Put it down as an excellent double stop. The first red card – Liverpool’s third of the league season – changed things, Klopp reconfiguring his side into a 4-4-1 with Gakpo to the right and Mohamed Salah up top. The first thing to say is that Jones had eyes on the ball and actually brushed the top of it before he clattered into Bissouma, making his opponent’s ankle buckle alarmingly. The force was strong and, when there was an announcement on the big screen of a VAR check for serious foul play, everybody knew what was coming. Then came the Díaz episode and, at that point, Spurs had to score to remind Liverpool that these kind of things come in threes. They did. James Maddison played Richarlison in behind Joe Gomez and he crossed for Son Heung-min to touch home. Richarlison, who had blasted high at 0-0 in the 33rd minute, rattled a post just before the board went up to show six additional minutes of first-half stoppage-time. A flag had been raised, although it was hard to see why. At which point Liverpool hauled themselves up off the canvas. Gakpo got on to a header from Virgil van Dijk and, with Micky van de Ven backing off, he turned and blasted past Vicario. Díaz should have made it 2-1 before the interval only to prod wide from Salah’s sumptuous cross. Spurs pushed on to the front foot at the start of the second half and Alisson needed to save brilliantly to keep out Maddison and Son. The latter also had the ball in the net only for an offside flag to go up correctly against Richarlison. The drama was only just beginning."
Everton,1,Luton,2,Luton gain first Premier League victory to pile more misery on Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/30/everton-luton-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-30,"Wild celebrations in one small corner of an otherwise deserted Goodison Park encapsulated a momentous, historic day for Luton. For the first time since April 1992, when Brian Stein and Mark Pembridge scored in a 2-0 win over Aston Villa, they had a top-flight victory to savour after inflicting fresh torment on clueless Everton. And relish it they did. “It is an amazing day for the supporters, they deserve it and the board deserve it too,” said Rob Edwards, the Luton manager after goals from Tom Lockyer and Carlton Morris, both from Alfie Doughty set-pieces, produced the club’s first win in the Premier League. “They’ve really stuck with us and I know they will because we’ve been on a brilliant journey, but it’s important we give them something to shout about as well. I know it’s a big moment, and I don’t want this to sound arrogant, but I really fancied us today. I really believed we could cause them problems and win the game.” Edwards’s justified confidence was a damning indictment of Everton’s home form and Sean Dyche’s tactics. His club picked an awful moment to lose a fourth consecutive home league game from the start of the season for the first time since 1958-59. Everton’s prospective new owners, 777 Partners, were in attendance in the form of co-founders Josh Wander and Steven Pasko plus the CEO, Don Dransfield. They have been doing the rounds this past week trying to reassure fans and politicians over their future intentions for Everton. That is a hard task given another of 777’s clubs, Vasco da Gama, were hit with a Fifa transfer ban on Friday over late payments on three transfer deals. Two encouraging away wins in five days suggested Everton had turned a corner. But they immediately reverted to type on home soil, missing several chances and compounding their problems at one end of the pitch with poor defending at the other. Dyche’s description of a dominant display with countless opportunities going astray, however, was a gross exaggeration. His team ran out of ideas quickly and rarely threatened Thomas Kaminski’s goal in the second half, even after Luton lost the defenders Lockyer and Reece Burke to injury. Everton were given several warnings about Doughty’s set-pieces before falling behind when Morris headed his corner against the crossbar. Ashley Young took too long to clear the rebound and Lockyer, alert to the opportunity, launched himself in front of the veteran’s clearance to divert home. Luton were in dreamland when doubling their lead moments later. A Doughty free-kick caused the damage this time, along with Everton leaving a big, lone centre-forward with a number nine on his back unmarked at the back post. Morris, having peeled away from Vitaliy Mykolenko unnoticed, steered a superb finish into the far corner. Dominic Calvert-Lewin spared Everton the embarrassment of becoming the first team in top-flight history to lose their opening four home games without scoring by scrambling in his third goal in three matches. A lengthy VAR check for offside against Amadou Onana and Calvert-Lewin found in Everton’s favour and the floundering hosts had a lifeline. They lacked the composure and quality to capitalise. Dyche introduced Jack Harrison, Beto and Arnaut Danjuma in a search for an equaliser that was simply too desperate and frantic. A series of aimless long balls made life easy for the promoted visitors who, despite the disruption to their defence, held Everton at bay comfortably in a second half featuring seven minutes of stoppage time. Luton looked the more dangerous team on the counterattack and Morris was denied his second, and the team’s third, when applying the finishing touch to a header from an offside Jacob Brown. “We had a brilliant chance today to change the story of the last two years and we didn’t do it,” said a despairing Dyche. “We are trying to create a mentality where the team is on it all the time. We have just taken two steps forward and now we’ve gone back again. It’s driving me mad.”"
Newcastle,2,Burnley,0,Miguel Almirón stunner sets Newcastle on their way to victory over Burnley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/30/newcastle-burnley-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-30,"On Wednesday night, the Champions League anthem will flood the senses here, Kylian Mbappé may or may not be fit to lead Paris Saint-Germain’s attack and Eddie Howe can, once again, confound the doubters. Newcastle’s manager has exceeded so many expectations in such a tight time frame on Tyneside that it is easy to forget it is almost exactly 11 years since he resigned as Burnley’s manager after a brief spell in east Lancashire. Although his return to Bournemouth was prompted by the death of his mother, there was a widespread, if erroneous assumption, that Howe could not cope outside his south-coast comfort zone. Back then few could have envisaged him thriving at St James’ Park, let alone preparing Newcastle for their first home Champions League game in 20 years. A team now boasting a record of five straight clean sheets did so with ruthless efficiency in the face of an enterprising, attractive Burnley, whose appealing brand of football is most definitely not reflected by the Premier League table. “It was a tough game,” said Howe after watching Miguel Almirón’s 20-yarder and Alexander Isak’s penalty secure three points. “Burnley are a really interesting team. Vincent [Kompany] has done a great job. They play a very dangerous style and if you aren’t perfect with your press they can hurt you. But we deserved to win.” Eleven years ago, Kompany was the cornerstone of Manchester City’s defence and it would certainly have been intriguing to see him mark Mbappé. Right now though the manager who led Burnley to last season’s Championship title in such style has quite enough on his plate. After seeing his side collect one point from their opening six games, Kompany is urging his players to keep the faith with the same sort of composure he once used to marshal City’s rearguard. “At the moment it’s not happening but it’s important to retain the belief,” he said. “Newcastle are a top side but we stayed in the game for long periods and we had our moments. That’s important. No one said it would be easy. It’s supposed to be tough.” On this evidence, Burnley possess sufficient talent and, judging by the way they won their fair share of second balls, character to weather the storm. In the first half, Luca Koleosho, their gifted Italy Under-21s winger, repeatedly sashayed down the right, discomfiting Dan Burn along the way. When Burn stumbled in the face of his impressive change of pace, Koleosho advanced and squared for Zeki Amdouni to shoot low. Nick Pope, a former Burnley goalkeeper, did well to keep that one out but while the visitors’ habit of playing out from the back was aesthetically pleasing it also seemed, at times, a high-risk strategy and Newcastle sensed opportunity. When Kieran Trippier, another Turf Moor old boy, dispossessed Aaron Ramsey courtesy of a powerful challenge the ball soon found itself at Almirón’s feet. The Paraguayan hesitated, momentarily, apparently uncertain whether or not to shoot. Then Almirón made the correct decision and watched his ensuing, left-foot, curving shot fly beyond the helpless James Trafford and on into the top corner. “Miggy’s a unique, high energy, all action, footballer,” said Howe. “I don’t think there’s anyone quite like him.” After that, Bruno Guimarães’s reassuring return to top form at the heart of a midfield, where Sean Longstaff also excelled, ensured Pope remained pretty much untested until midway through the second half when Newcastle were disrupted by Joelinton’s hamstring injury. The Brazilian lasted three minutes after replacing Elliot Anderson before limping off as Sandro Tonali ran on. One of Kompany’s substitutes, Wilson Odobert very nearly capitalised on this temporary confusion as he burst into the area, unhinging a defence lacking the injured Sven Botman and forcing a couple of slightly panicky clearances. It served as a reminder that Newcastle needed a second goal. It arrived when Isak beat Trafford from the penalty spot after Ameen al‑Dakhil felled Gordon. Struck low and unerringly into the bottom right corner, Isak’s kick was unstoppable. “We’re in a good moment,” said Howe. “We can approach the Champions League with confidence.”"
West Ham,2,Sheffield,0,Bowen and Soucek ease West Ham to victory against insipid Sheffield United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/30/west-ham-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-30,"The strange thing was that none of Sheffield United’s players even tried to rattle West Ham. Paul Heckingbottom’s side were insipid beyond belief on an afternoon devoid of drama and intensity, their defensive foundations crumbling under the slightest pressure, and it said little for their hopes of staying up that they were so easily swatted aside by opponents who spent the second half protecting their legs before visiting Freiburg in the Europa League on Thursday. West Ham were playing the game on their terms by that stage, goals from Jarrod Bowen and Tomas Soucek inside the opening 37 minutes allowing them to save their energy for tougher assignments. If there were positives for Sheffield United, who remain bottom after earning one point from their opening seven games, it was only that they did not lose by more. Do not be fooled by hints of defiance once it was 2-0: West Ham finished the job during the first half, exposing naive defending with incisive attacking, and the absence of any competitiveness when it was goalless will surely raise further doubts over Paul Heckingbottom’s future. “I look at the first half and probably think we passed the ball OK but we were too loose in possession,” Sheffield United’s manager said. “The distances between us as a team were far too big. “When we lost possession we didn’t have enough to win it back. It’s clear why we lost.” It was easy to imagine him focusing on making his side hard to beat after their 8-0 defeat to Newcastle last weekend. For that to work, though, Sheffield United would need to stay switched on throughout. They would have to snap into every challenge and make life horrible for West Ham. As it was they were incapable of mustering any spirit or organisation. The writing was on the wall when meek defending from James McAtee let Bowen through on the right after five minutes. All that spared McAtee was a poor finish from Soucek, who fired over from close range, but there was no sign of Sheffield United heeding the warning. They were lucky not to concede when an unchallenged Bowen headed a corner from James Ward-Prowse straight at Wes Foderingham and while the visitors offered a brief threat when Cameron Archer forced Nayef Aguerd to block a goalbound shot early on their resistance soon faded. West Ham always had an extra gear, particularly when Lucas Paquetá drifted in from the left to create. When the opener arrived, though, there was no role for Paquetá. A patient move developed on the right and involved Edson Álvarez and Bowen combining before Soucek released Vladimir Coufal with a beautiful pass. The crispness of football worthy of West Ham’s attacking traditions left Sheffield United chasing shadows. Coufal’s forays from right-back overwhelmed Luke Thomas and nobody stayed with Bowen’s run. Given time, there was no chance of the West Ham forward missing as he met Coufal’s cutback with the inside of his left foot and increased his chances of being named in the England squad next week by producing a measured finish for his fifth goal of the season. “Jarrod’s as close now as he’s ever been,” David Moyes said. “He looks quick, sharp, really slick. To play for England you have to be good at scoring in big games. Jarrod’s doing great for us. He was a wee bit unlucky not to have more goals today.” West Ham were soon chasing further goals, Michail Antonio twice going close. Sheffield United were hanging on and the pressure told when a tentative attempt to play out from the back culminated in Gustavo Hamer conceding possession after dropping back from midfield. Emerson Palmieri intercepted his pass, Antonio found Soucek and the midfielder sorted out his feet before beating Foderingham. Sheffield United, who lost their captain, John Egan to injury, had to fight. Oli McBurnie wasted a golden opportunity just before half-time and the second half began with Coufal thwarting Archer. Alphonse Areola saved a header from Anel Ahmedhodzic. Yet with West Ham defending well and maintaining a threat on the break, there was no way back for Sheffield United. Winless, devoid of belief and low on quality, they already look destined to return to the Championship."
Wolves,2,City,1,Wolves stun Manchester City as Hwang wrecks champions’ perfect league start,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/30/wolves-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-30,"Last weekend footage of a Sheffield United supporter engrossed in a book at 7-0 down went viral and before kick-off here a fan was turning the pages of a title called Best New Horror. For Pep Guardiola, observing events from the directors’ box because of a one-match touchline ban, it was probably something close to that as Manchester City suffered a shock defeat at Wolves, their flawless start to defending their crown coming to an abrupt end. The only reading material Guardiola is likely to consume before switching his focus to Wednesday’s Champions League trip to Leipzig is his staff’s analysis of why things unravelled. A couple of minutes before kick-off Guardiola took his position in the front row of the executive area, sandwiched between Manel Estiarte, City’s head of player support, and Txiki Begiristain, their director of football. It was there where Guardiola clenched both fists when Julián Álvarez pulled City level with a stunning free-kick, whipped into the top corner. José Sá, the Wolves goalkeeper, got his right hand to it but was powerless to prevent the ball spinning in. Wolves led inside 13 minutes via a Rúben Dias own goal and Guardiola looked on sternly when the hosts regained the lead midway through the second half through Hwang Hee-chan. Kyle Walker tried in vain to head the ball clear on the goalline. A fortnight ago Wolves blew Liverpool away in the first half here before crumbling in the second and in their first game of the season, at Old Trafford, they departed empty-handed despite being the superior team. Even in midweek they caved, squandering a two-goal lead at Ipswich in the Carabao Cup. So the question on the lips of supporters here at half-time, at which point they led 1-0, was: could they really hold on against the champions? When Álvarez sent a wicked free-kick into the top corner after João Gomes was penalised for bumping Oscar Bobb over 20 yards from goal, another capitulation – given City’s obvious might – seemed a distinct possibility. “It was a big blow, because it wasn’t like they cut us open,” said the Wolves manager, Gary O’Neil. “I think everybody in the country probably expected Man City to go on to win at that point.” But Wolves, who invariably had to ride a couple of waves of sustained City pressure, including six minutes of second-half stoppage time, were stout in defence and smart in attack. Rayan Aït-Nouri enjoyed a fine game at left wing-back and Pedro Neto was again superb, his direct running the catalyst for the opener. Neto whizzed past Nathan Aké, one of two changes from City’s last league match, and Dias inadvertently diverted past Ederson. Matheus Cunha also worked tirelessly as a lone striker, screening City’s midfield pivot. “We did some work on it on Thursday and after six minutes I could see his brain was starting to fry,” O’Neil said. “I was like: ‘Come on mate, we’ve done six minutes, we’re going to need 90 of this on Saturday.’ Man City test you mentally, if anyone switches off, they will find it. I tried to make sure they understood: ‘If it looks like a tactics board, we have a real chance of winning the game.’” It was a Molineux return to forget for Matheus Nunes, signed by City for £53m at the end of last month. Nunes, whose every touch was heavily jeered by the home support, was replaced by Bobb at half-time. “Nunes, what’s the score,” came the riposte from the delighted Wolves fans at the final whistle. Gomes, in effect his replacement, and Mario Lemina racked up some mileage in midfield and who was confident Craig Dawson would totally subdue Erling Haaland? “Rodri makes that team tick a lot better,” O’Neil said afterwards and Guardiola would surely concur. The City manager played down his pitch-side absence being a factor, given he was in dialogue with Carlos Vicens, one of his assistants, who fed instructions to another, Juanma Lillo. “The view is perfect,” the City manager said of the directors’ box. “I spoke to the team in the hotel, I spoke [to them] before the game, at half-time and after the game. During the game you can be involved in something but not ‘manager.’ The players know exactly what they have to do. What we should do we have done I don’t know how many times since we’ve been here. So many teams set up with a 5-4-1 or 5-3-2. They [City players] know exactly what to do. Wolves defended incredibly well.” City, who named only eight substitutes, including two goalkeepers, succumbed to their first league defeat since May, their second in the space of four days having lost to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup in midweek. Wolves’ winner was typical of the way they attacked this game. Nélson Semedo flew down the right flank and his cross struck Aké at the front post en route to Hwang, whose initial shot was blocked by a sprawling Dias. Cunha collected the leftovers and showed poise to calmly lay the ball on for Hwang to leather in at the second attempt."
United,0,Palace,1,Manchester United booed off after Crystal Palace’s Andersen piles on pain,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/30/manchester-united-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-30,"Erik ten Hag will have to discard the buzzword Manchester United’s manager came into this game citing. “Momentum” is now obliterated after a defeat that ends a run of victories at two as, yet again, his men must regroup, this time for Galatasaray’s visit on Tuesday in the Champions League. United have lost four of their seven first league games. This last occurred in 1989-90, the season in which the infamous “Ta Ra Fergie” banner was held up at a match in December to demand that Alex Ferguson be sacked. The Scot was not, of course, but Ten Hag will know he has to stem the serial losses or his job will be in danger; his team have scored a paltry seven times and have a goal difference of minus four. At the close there were boos. “I understand,” the Dutchman said. “We played at home and we played Crystal Palace, who we have to beat, with all respect. I know every game in the Premier League is difficult, you have to play your best and I understand fans expect their best.” On Friday the manager named Alejandro Garnacho as a player who was not in the team as a result of not performing. Yet United were suddenly an electric proposition when the rocket-booted winger came on in the second half. In one moment of devilry Garnacho bamboozled Crystal Palace along their right byline, his cross ricocheting off two defenders as the ball threatened to go anywhere – including past Sam Johnstone for the equaliser. But no. Joachim Andersen’s smash-and-grab strike in the opening half allowed Palace revenge for Tuesday’s 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat despite United dominating the closing phase; in added time the substitute Donny van de Beek nodded the ball to Garnacho, who had his shot saved by the impressive Johnstone from close in. Garnacho had taken over on the left from a tepid Marcus Rashford, who was replaced by Christian Eriksen a little after the youngster’s introduction. Rashford has only one goal this season and Ten Hag accepted he is misfiring. “He knows he can do better and I am sure it will come,” said the manager. “He works hard. He will net and it will come but it is not going to be automatic. The team has to invest a lot around him. Today the decision-making was not good enough.” Ten Hag also admitted he has to work to stave off this being a long campaign of taking one step forward and then two steps back. “Of course that is the concern and we have to be more consistent,” he said. “The demand is we get a row of wins and we have to do better than we do now. I can give you reasons but you will explain it as an excuse and there are no excuses – we need to win.” Asked if United are a soft touch before their own crowd, Ten Hag demurred – but only just. “We have now lost two games in a row here in the Premier League but I won’t set that conclusion now,” he said. “We have to do better, that is definitely the case, and we have to show it in our body language that Old Trafford is a fortress and you can’t get anything here and the only thing you can go away from here with is a loss.” For Roy Hodgson victory was just dandy, and makes him the first manager in Premier League history to be undefeated here in five consecutive games – four with Palace and once with Watford. “I am happy about that,” he said. “What I am most happy about is the way the team played and so pleased for the players – it’s not easy coming here for the second time in a few days and give that performance and work so hard for 90 minutes. I am not certain I can tell you about the other games before though I am pretty sure I would have been delighted about those too.” United’s concession came via self-destructive defending. Eberechi Eze hit over a free-kick from the right and those in red allowed the ball to go all the way to Andersen, with Rasmus Højlund the chief culprit for missing a header. Andersen hit a sweet finish past André Onana into the goalkeeper’s left corner."
Bournemouth,0,Arsenal,4,Kai Havertz off the mark as Arsenal breeze past winless Bournemouth,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/30/bournemouth-arsenal-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-30,"There had been times, even at such an early point in his Arsenal career, when the unrelenting scrutiny that accompanies a £65m price tag was a visible millstone around Kai Havertz’s neck. His teammates knew it and, on an afternoon that could hardly have gone more smoothly from their perspective, decided to lighten the load. A one-sided match was already half-won when Ryan Christie lunged messily at Martin Ødegaard eight minutes after half-time, giving them their second penalty and a chance to move out of sight. Bukayo Saka placed the ball but, to cheers from the away support, promptly elected to step aside. Up walked Havertz and, even if the day’s stakes were relatively low by this point, a neutral might have felt a flutter of anxiety on his behalf. He has not played badly since making the inherently risky move from Chelsea, primarily to operate in midfield, but even a cod body language analyst would have been justified in observing a lack of confidence around opposition 18-yard boxes. Fluffing his lines here could have opened a fresh can of worms but he sent Neto the wrong way unfussily and, with Gabriel Magalhães as chief cheerleader, was encouraged to milk the faithful’s acclaim. “If there’s a player who deserves that it’s Kai Havertz, I’m so happy for him,” Mikel Arteta said. “I’m really happy for the win, but even happier to be part of a team that shows the human qualities they did today. Without me telling them anything, to show that empathy to a player that has some question marks to resolve externally, they warmed me even more.” The goal put Arsenal three up and helped ensure that, with additional thanks to events at Molineux, they sit on Manchester City’s tails before their meeting next Sunday. Bournemouth offered little resistance, making a game of it only until Saka nodded a 17th-minute opener. He showed a poacher’s instinct sits within his vast suite of skills after Gabriel Jesus, who had perhaps meant to locate a colleague, headed against the near post from a tight angle. The outcome was all but assured from there. “We read the game very well and earned the right to win it,” Arteta said. Arsenal’s only scare came early on when Dominic Solanke appeared to have got away only for William Saliba, one of several pre-match doubts who pulled through in time to start, to thwart him with a cocktail of recovery and timing. They repelled Bournemouth’s probings and struck again before half-time when Eddie Nketiah, sent down the left by a one-two with the excellent Oleksandr Zinchenko, lured Max Aarons into a mistimed sliding challenge. Ødegaard assumed spot-kick duties in the first instance, converting calmly, and it meant Arsenal were comfortable enough for Havertz to have his day later on. Arteta suggested it could “change everything” for Havertz and referred to a famous line from Usain Bolt, in which the sprinter pointed out it took four years to train for a nine-second time. Arsenal kept up the pace for the remainder, the substitute Emile Smith Rowe coming close twice and a garnish arriving in added time when Ben White headed in an Ødegaard free-kick. Bournemouth remain winless after a testing early run and hope a softer-looking October will give Andoni Iraola’s reign an uplift. The trailed battle of wits between Iraola and Arteta, boyhood teammates at Antiguoko in San Sebastián, never caught light. “It’s the first time I’ve felt we weren’t at the level the competition required,” Iraola said. “We need to be at our best to compete against this kind of team and we weren’t.” The only note of concern for Arteta was a familiar one, Saka limping off in clear pain 14 minutes from time. Arteta referred to a “stamp”, seemingly on the same foot that took a blow against Spurs the previous week. Saka will, like Arsenal, doubtless go again. “It’s a long marathon,” Arteta said, dampening title talk, but he could openly rejoice that Havertz is building momentum at last."
Villa,6,Brighton,1,Ollie Watkins’ hat-trick helps rampant Aston Villa hit Brighton for six,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/30/aston-villa-brighton-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-30,"Two aspirant clubs, a pair of transformative managers, both aiming to crash the elite. Each admires the other, but it was Roberto De Zerbi who received a lesson from the greater wiles of Unai Emery, as a masterclass in centre-forward play from Ollie Watkins took a wrecking ball to Brighton. Emery is a manager of meticulous research, often knowing his opponents perhaps even better than they do themselves. Time and again, his Aston Villa team picked at the weakness at the point of transition that is the soft underbelly of Brighton’s counterpressing machine. Gareth Southgate, watching the club he once captained, cannot have failed to be impressed by Watkins, with three goals and an assist. “I just try to perform and I want to score every game,” said Watkins, a model in modesty for someone who had become the first Villa player to score two hat-tricks in a season since Andy Gray in 1976-77. “There have been a few games this season when I should have scored and I came off disappointed.” Both managers retained permanent presences on the sidelines, Emery in constant motion, urging, clapping, forever tweaking. De Zerbi kept his hands in pocket, pacing like a Ryder Cup captain watching another vital putt slide by as his team repeatedly lost their key battles. “We can’t lose every tackle, every duel, every second ball,” said De Zerbi. “Otherwise, we lose this game, but I believe in my players.” Villa, clad in their infamous, wet-look, heavy-wearing home kits, pressed hard and aggressively from the get-go. Brighton’s was a collective collapse, but their defence suffered a harrowing lunchtime. Their two Premier League defeats have seen Watkins and West Ham’s Michail Antonio – powerful, canny, speedy strikers – roast Adam Webster in particular. “We did fantastic with Watkins fighting, Moussa Diaby and John McGinn,” said Emery after his third win in a row over De Zerbi. “We had to build with ball possession which we did as well. We needed a different tactical gameplan and we followed it.” Even as Brighton dominated early possession, it was Villa breaking more dangerously. A major chance saw Watkins enraged when Diaby over-deliberated. He was smiling soon enough once McGinn’s pass sent Matty Cash clear down the right. A finish from a yard out was his only requirement. The second was all Watkins’ own work in chasing down Joël Veltman before checking back to slot past Jason Steele. Brighton claimed Nicolò Zaniolo’s dummy run had unsighted the goalkeeper but VAR offered them no reprieve. Nor did Villa, the wind in their sails. Douglas Luiz clattered into Solly March, another possible infringement waved away by those at Stockley Park, and Watkins set up Diaby whose second attempt on goal was turned into his own net by Pervis Estupiñán. De Zerbi, never afraid to trust youth, had selected the debutant Jack Hinshelwood, who completed 87 minutes when other, more celebrated teammates, were unceremoniously removed. The experience gained by the 18-year-old numbered among few positives. “There was no battle today, this was not the true Brighton,” his manager complained. When Danny Welbeck is committing vicious fouls, it spells panic in the ranks. Evan Ferguson was a spectator to Watkins’ object lesson in leading the line and did not feature beyond the break. “Everything,” replied De Zerbi when asked what had gone wrong, before emphasising the increased workload of Europa League football. “Playing Saturday and Saturday is one type of sport, playing every three days is another sport.” Half-time saw the introduction of Ansu Fati amid a triple substitution and he soon scored his first Brighton goal following a quickly taken free-kick. It was a foothold soon enough plunged from. Risk and reward is central to De Zerbi’s approach. Emery is more risk-averse. On came Jacob Ramsey to lock down midfield and the echoes of the first half rang out as Villa sprang the trap three times more. Watkins was again the self-starter, intercepting and interchanging with McGinn to reaching his hat-trick via the prostrate form of the hapless Webster. Worse would follow for beleaguered Brighton. Goals from Ramsey, the local hero, and Douglas Luiz, his fifth in five home matches, were both the result of the visitors being unable to cope with a still rampaging Watkins. It completed a dream day for Villa, their manager and his striker, each underestimated at their opponent’s peril."
Sheffield,0,Newcastle,8,Newcastle thrash Sheffield United 8-0 as Alexander Isak caps humiliation,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/24/sheffield-united-newcastle-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-24,"As Newcastle’s players and staff stood in a line applauding the supporters serenading them in the lower bank of the Bramall Lane Stand after a record-breaking away win, the clock on the scoreboard looking back at them was still ticking away. It was a good job then that, by that point, Sheffield United’s players had long since traipsed down the tunnel, such was Newcastle’s overwhelming appetite to put on a show, persistently pushing to cut a little bit deeper. It was in effect game over inside 35 minutes, by which point Eddie Howe’s side were three goals to the good, but Newcastle were relentless, bloodthirsty and ended up bludgeoning the hosts to the tune of eight goals to nil, for their biggest away league win. Stuart McCall, the Sheffield United assistant manager, could not bear to look as Alexander Isak got in on the act, covering his face as the substitute wheeled away in celebration after adding a history-making eighth, the first time there have been eight different scorers in a Premier League match. After Miguel Almirón weighed in with Newcastle’s sixth on 68 minutes, sweeping home after exchanging passes with Bruno Guimarães and ripping through the hosts’ absent three-man defence, it was hard not to feel for Paul Heckingbottom and his side as the visitors readied a triple substitution. Signed for a combined £160m, enter Isak, Sandro Tonali and Tino Livramento, the latter for his debut. At 7-0, one home fan resorted to burying her head into a book to distract from events on the pitch. Last weekend Sheffield United were guilty of time-wasting at Tottenham – their attempts to eke out a precious victory backfiring in stoppage time – but here they could not wait to be put out of their misery. Worse still, Sheffield United’s secretary can expect correspondence from the Football Association after supporters threw missiles at the Newcastle players as they celebrated Sven Botman’s deft header from Kieran Trippier’s superb free-kick, the third goal for those who could be forgiven for losing count. Botman and his teammates headed to the nearest corner flag, in front of the Kop Stand and Elliot Anderson was struck by a bottle that exploded as it cannoned off his left foot. A few other bottles were launched towards the celebrating players. It was hard to believe the first 20 minutes were part of the same game, before which the home club paid an emotional tribute to Maddy Cusack, their former women’s team player who died last week aged 27. A greyscale image of Cusack adorned the programme cover and the flag on top of the main stand flew at half mast. Newcastle were fairly flat initially and Luke Thomas, the Sheffield United wing‑back on loan from Leicester, squandered two decent chances to open the scoring, the second coming after James McAtee, on loan from Manchester City, played a delightful outside-of-the-boot cross in from the right. Newcastle had to cope with Harvey Barnes departing prematurely with a toe injury but his replacement, Anthony Gordon, crafted the opener for Sean Longstaff and scored a peach to make it five just after the hour. Anderson fed Gordon on the edge of the 18‑yard box and Gordon bounced inside and curled a beautiful right-foot strike into the bottom corner. The result equals Newcastle’s biggest win, 8-0 at home against Sheffield United’s rivals Sheffield Wednesday at St James’ Park in 1999, when Alan Shearer scored five. “We want to attack well, we want to entertain, we want to be good value when people come to see us play,” Howe said. “One of our fundamental beliefs is that we are always looking to score and with top-quality players it can happen, but very rarely. We’ll enjoy it tonight and then quickly forget about it.” By the end, the controversy around the first goal felt an awful long time ago. Gordon appeared to handle the ball as he kept play in on the byline before picking out Longstaff, who swept a first-time shot into the net. Even Longstaff seemed unsure as to whether the goal would stand as he embraced Gordon but the goal was cleared by the officials. There was bedlam in the away end when Dan Burn lost Anel Ahmedhodzic at a corner to head in Newcastle’s second. Jayden Bogle was fortunate to avoid conceding a penalty when he clipped Gordon a couple of minutes after Botman’s headed goal and Callum Wilson, who added Newcastle’s fourth 11 minutes into the second half, could have had a first‑half hat‑trick. But Wilson registered his 15th goal in his past 18 league games with a diving header from Trippier’s cross after Fabian Schär strode forward. There was still plenty more pain for Sheffield United to stomach. The links with the former manager Chris Wilder will not go away and Heckingbottom’s position is hardly going to be more comfortable after overseeing this humiliation. After six league games, Sheffield United are winless and bottom of the pile. “I think this might be a thing now, by the looks of it,” Heckingbottom said of the recurring speculation. “It has been a really tough week and one we want over.”"
Arsenal,2,Spurs,2,Son Heung-min double hands Spurs share of derby spoils against Arsenal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/24/arsenal-tottenham-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-24,"But who have they beaten? Three teams in the bottom four and, er, Manchester United. Tottenham had heard the attempts to explain away their excellent start to life under Ange Postecoglou, their finest opening to a season in 58 years. This would be the acid test, a truer gauge of where they stood – a derby against their neighbours at whose stadium they never seem to win. What we learned after a stirring contest is that they are looking like a serious proposition. Postecoglou’s team were unable to record what would have been only a second Premier League win in 31 attempts on enemy turf. But what the manager wanted to see from his players was personality and the imposition of their style. He certainly got that. Son Heung-min was razor‑sharp, scoring a pair of equalisers, answering the Bukayo Saka-forced Cristian Romero own goal and a Saka penalty, conceded by Romero. But Son was ably supported by a clutch of stellar individual performances – most notably from Yves Bissouma, a titan in central midfield. Destiny Udogie was a powerhouse from left‑back, recovering from a difficult start that meant he was booked for a lunge at Saka, while James Maddison had his moments, setting up both goals. There was steel and control from Spurs, no panic when the board went up to show 10 additional minutes. If anything, they looked the likelier scorers of a winner in the closing stages and the post-match scenes were telling, Postecoglou and his players taking the acclaim of the visiting fans. Arsenal did not do enough. They were flying after their 4-0 Champions League win over PSV Eindhoven in midweek, unbeaten since the start of the season, but they came to look heavy, lacking in inspiration in the second half. They missed Declan Rice after he was forced off with a back problem at the interval and the injured Gabriel Martinelli, who did not play at all. Nobody in an Arsenal shirt really seized the occasion. They were not the story here. Mikel Arteta had faced Postecoglou before – when he was Pep Guardiola’s No 2 at Manchester City and they met Postecoglou’s Yokohama F. Marinos in a 2019 friendly. City won but what was notable was how Yokohama hogged 58% of the ball. “They played some incredible football,” Guardiola said. Postecoglou wants to play only his way – on the front foot, possession-heavy, well-grooved combinations. Arsenal were determined not to let them and one of the key battle areas was when Spurs had the ball in their defensive third. Arsenal put huge pressure on the ball as they sought to build. Spurs showed their nerve. The transitions were everything, the speed of them breathtaking, including the one for the breakthrough goal. Postecoglou watched Dejan Kulusevski run left to right and then run out of options, losing the ball. The manager gestured in frustration. He knew there was danger coming. Arsenal moved slickly, Martin Ødegaard coming right to Saka, who cut inside and shaped a trademark curler, the ball flying past the helpless Guglielmo Vicario off Romero’s outstretched leg. Arsenal had threatened before then. Gabriel Jesus, who Arteta played off the left-wing, worked Vicario from a tight angle; Eddie Nketiah did likewise from the right after a loose Micky van de Ven back-pass. Might Ntekiah have cut the ball back? A turning point came on 32 minutes when so many of the main themes coalesced. Spurs played out through Vicario to Maddison, who took too long on the edge of the box and was robbed by Jesus, who had to score. Instead, he blazed high. Maddison did not let his head drop. Udogie continued to drive and Spurs stuck to the gameplan. They deserved the equaliser. Brennan Johnson, on his full Spurs debut, drew a smart save out of David Raya after a Son incision, the Arsenal goalkeeper moving quickly across his line. Raya would deny Johnson again after a weak punch on a Pape Sarr cross. Yet Spurs recycled the ball, Udogie heading to Maddison, who turned away from Saka’s challenge and pulled back, Son timing his arrival to flick home. The penalty at the start of the second half was a body blow for Spurs after they defended a corner poorly, allowing the delivery to bounce and leaving Ben White alone in front of goal. When he spun and shot, the ball banged into the ground and reared up to hit Romero’s outstretched hand. It was not his day. Saka chipped his kick up the middle with beautiful disguise. Back came Spurs. Again. Arteta had introduced Jorginho and Kai Havertz into midfield at half-time, Rice and Fábio Vieira making way. And it was Jorginho who gave it away. Again, it was a high turnover that provided the talking point, the catalyst. He tried to step away from Maddison but was dispossessed and Spurs had two on one, Maddison drawing William Saliba to play in Son, whose finish was nerveless. Both teams had the chances to nick it, Havertz lashing high when well placed and Saka extending Vicario after a corner. For Spurs, Son went close after a Kulusevski pass and, at the very end, the substitute Richarlison saw a shot deflect wide off Jorginho after Bissouma had stepped up imperiously to feed Kulusevski for the cross."
Chelsea,0,Villa,1,Aston Villa’s Watkins piles misery on struggling Chelsea after Gusto’s red card,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/24/chelsea-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-24,"In the final reckoning it was easier for Chelsea to talk about misfortune in front of goal and rage at an unpopular referee. There is comfort in complaining about injustice and Mauricio Pochettino could argue that his side’s second consecutive defeat at an irate Stamford Bridge hinged on Jarred Gillett dismissing Malo Gusto early in the second half, allowing Aston Villa to take control of a game that had threatened to run away from them. Yet the problem with blaming the officials is that Chelsea no longer make their own luck. They have lost the fear factor at home and the situation is unlikely to improve until their main striker learns how to stay onside and manages to stop picking up cheap yellow cards. How infuriating for Pochettino to see Nicolas Jackson ignore his advice about improving his behaviour and earn his fifth booking of the season for stopping Villa from taking a quick free-kick. Such folly epitomised this inexperienced group’s indiscipline. No wonder Pochettino admitted that his team have to grow up. It was so unnecessary from Jackson – none of his cautions have been for a foul – and for all the fury over Gusto’s red for a risky challenge on Lucas Digne the truth is that Chelsea would be better served examining their own failings at both ends of the pitch. There is no shortage of statistics to make Chelsea wince. They have made their worst start to a season in 45 years, earning five points from their first six games, and have gone 285 minutes without a goal in the league. It is a mess. Chelsea have broken the British transfer record twice this year, bolstering their midfield by paying £106.8m for Enzo Fernández and £115m for Moisés Caicedo, and look further away than ever from challenging for a place in the top four. Beating them does not take much. Villa were nothing special, creating little before Ollie Watkins scored his first goal of the season, punishing an error by Thiago Silva by breaking the deadlock in the 73rd minute. Unai Emery’s side lacked cohesion at first. Villa were leggy after losing at Legia Warsaw in the Europa Conference League on Thursday; Chelsea should have taken advantage. The hosts were sharper during the early stages, with Raheem Sterling causing problems on the right and Mykhailo Mudryk in effervescent form on the left. He is yet to hit his stride since leaving Shakhtar Donetsk in January, but the first 45 minutes were surely Mudryk’s best in a blue shirt. The winger was full of positive intent on the ball, repeatedly testing Matty Cash, and should have gone in at half-time with at least one assist to his name. Of the standout contributions from Mudryk, there was the moment when he tore beyond Cash and his fizzing cross just evaded Fernández at the far post. Better still was when the Ukrainian sliced Villa open with a beautiful reverse pass to Jackson, who saw his shot turned behind by Emi Martínez. Shoddy finishing is the main dilemma for Chelsea, who have beaten only Bournemouth and Luton in the league since sacking Graham Potter in April. There was a poor effort from Fernández, wasting good work from Gusto on the right. Sterling kept exposing Villa’s risky high line but could not find a final pass. Villa settled down. Boubacar Kamara, Douglas Luiz and John McGinn competed with Fernández, Caicedo and the erratic Conor Gallagher. Chelsea needed Robert Sánchez to make stunning saves from Digne and Nicolò Zaniolo before half-time. Chelsea did not deserve to trail at that stage. They pushed again at the start of the second half, Sterling continuing to torment Digne, Martínez denying the winger. For all their promise, though, Chelsea are painfully naive. Jackson, dangerous but raw, was supposed to be on his best behaviour. The 22-year-old let Pochettino down when he earned the booking that rules him out of the trip to Fulham a week on Monday. Worse was to follow when Gusto leapt into a challenge near the right touchline. The right-back’s studs were high and Digne went down in pain. It was not a surprise when the VAR, Andrew Madley, advised Gillett to upgrade Gusto’s booking to a red. Chelsea had to retreat. Pochettino made a defensive change, Mudryk off for Ben Chilwell, Axel Disasi moving to right-back. It worked at first. Chelsea sat back, limiting Villa to efforts from Cash and Moussa Diaby. Yet everything fell apart when Villa broke from a corner, Diaby able to release Watkins after a slip from the increasingly suspect Silva. Watkins ran at Levi Colwill, now playing in central defence after starting at left-back, and his initial shot was blocked. No matter. Watkins regained possession and sent an angled drive past Sánchez. What Chelsea would pay for that efficiency. They chased an equaliser, Martínez denying Chilwell, Cole Palmer going close after coming on, but there was little cohesion. The club who have spent £1bn remain stuck in 14th place."
Liverpool,3,West Ham,1,Darwin Núñez and Diogo Jota fire Liverpool to win against West Ham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/24/liverpool-west-ham-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-24,"Something is growing at Liverpool in the supremely qualified opinion of Jürgen Klopp. That judgment applies to expectations at Anfield this season, as well as the development of his refreshed, gifted and hungry team. West Ham were comfortably eclipsed as Liverpool registered a sixth successive win in all competitions with plenty to spare. David Moyes’s visitors started brightly and deserved to head in level at the interval. Once Liverpool’s quality on the ball improved in the second half, however, West Ham were subdued and unable to contain the movement around them. Moyes’s long wait for a first win at Anfield goes on. Mohamed Salah gave Liverpool the lead from the penalty spot – he has now scored in 12 of his team’s last 13 home games – before second-half goals from Darwin Núñez and substitute Diogo Jota made Jarrod Bowen’s equaliser a distant consolation. Michail Antonio’s confident boast that West Ham will finish above Liverpool looks seriously misplaced on current evidence. “It was a difficult game, like we expected,” said Klopp. “We had good moments in the first half but were not in control to deny them completely. We lost some balls we shouldn’t have lost and when they scored I was not completely surprised. “We didn’t concede first this time but we conceded anyway, and that’s not great, and the reaction was top. That’s important because we have to be a team that’s difficult to deal with. “We were better in possession in the second half. At 2-1 up we had our best phase of the game. We kept West Ham calm with our ball possession, which is the best way to protect. I saw a lot of good stuff today.” West Ham were in the ascendancy and could have been two goals ahead when they presented Liverpool with an early lead. A loose header from James Ward-Prowse was intercepted by Curtis Jones and the hosts countered through Luis Díaz. His low cross clipped Núñez’s heel and Nayef Aguerd, wrong-footed as a result, conceded the clearest of penalties with a trip on Salah. Salah picked himself up to send Alphonse Areola the wrong way from the spot. It was a timely break for Liverpool, who were indebted to Alisson for a superb goalline save from a Tomas Soucek header and a glaring miss from Antonio, heading well wide from the Czech midfielder’s inviting cross, for not having to come from behind once again. Dominik Szoboszlai was decorating the contest with touches of class, matching his talent with a prodigious work rate, and Liverpool pressed for the comfort of a second goal. Virgil van Dijk shot over when picked out by an Andy Robertson corner. Salah swept a first time shot wide from Díaz’s layoff. But a second remained elusive and West Ham carried a persistent threat in the form of Lucas Paquetá, Bowen and Antonio. All three were involved in a fine and merited equaliser shortly before the break. Bowen headed Paquetá’s lofted ball into the path of Antonio, who released Vladimir Coufal down the right with a perfectly weighted pass. The full-back threaded a cross between two Liverpool defenders and Bowen, launching himself in front of Van Dijk, steered a superb diving header in off Alisson’s right post. Szoboszlai was unfortunate not to have a glorious assist when arcing a stunning pass behind the West Ham defence for Jones to volley home. The midfielder had just strayed offside when the Hungary international spotted an option that few others could see. A similar routine restored Liverpool’s lead on the hour, however. This time Alexis Mac Allister floated a beautiful pass over Aguerd and Núñez, pulling off the shoulder of the last defender, guided an acrobatic volley beyond Areola. An excellent goal was reward for the centre-forward’s tireless shift plus his refusal to be affected by a glaring miss when unmarked in front of goal five minutes earlier. Bowen, who returned to team training after illness only on Saturday, missed a good opening early in the second half too, heading a Ward-Prowse free-kick straight at the Liverpool goalkeeper from inside the six-yard area. It was a costly miss as West Ham struggled to match the home side’s intensity or composure in possession thereafter. Liverpool added the third their second-half dominance deserved late on from a Robertson corner. Van Dijk soared above the West Ham defence to head the delivery back across goal and Jota, perfectly placed five minutes after his introduction from the bench, swept in from close range. Moyes reflected: “We did a lot of good things today but I come away from here saying the same things too often. I’m sick of saying it. We ran both Manchester City and Liverpool close in the last two games but we gave three goals away in the second half against City and two away in the second half today. “I have to find a way to put in the same energy levels in the second half as the first, but overall it has been a really good start to the season by us.”"
Brighton,3,Bournemouth,1,Mitoma double gives Brighton win over Bournemouth and puts them third,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/24/brighton-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-24,"Another win to fire Brighton to the heady heights of third in the Premier League table and three more goals to cement their place as the division’s free‑scoring entertainers, but it takes more than that to appease such a demanding character as Roberto De Zerbi. “Today we played one of the worst games in my time,” the Italian said, bluntly, of his side’s comeback victory against Bournemouth. “In two, three, four situations we were lucky. Bournemouth played a great first half. In the second half we played better, but not of our best level.” Another manager might well have seen reason to show leniency towards his players. Coming just three days after their European debut against AEK Athens, it was perhaps no surprise that a much‑changed Brighton side looked bereft of ideas for some time in this game, struggling to threaten a Bournemouth team whose promising performances have largely belied their low position in the league. That the half-time substitute Kaoru Mitoma’s double secured a fifth win in six matches means it is not inconceivable Brighton’s sights could be set even higher than Europe’s second-tier competition come the end of the season should they remain in the Champions League spots – a remarkable position, even at this embryonic stage of the campaign, given their high-profile departures during the summer. But for De Zerbi, there is only improvement to seek. “Today was the first time we played after Europe,” he said. “We have to adapt. We are not used, yet, to playing three games in a week. I’m pleased because we won with character and with passion, not with the style or quality of play. But the football is showing the character. It’s a very important part of football – maybe the most important.” There was an element of fortune about Brighton’s equaliser in first‑half stoppage time, after Dominic Solanke had given Bournemouth a deserved early lead, with Milos Kerkez misjudging his leap and flicking Billy Gilmour’s whipped cross into his own net. De Zerbi’s bold double substitution at the break then altered the course of the match in astonishingly quick time when Mitoma and Ansu Fati combined to put the hosts in front just 15 seconds after being introduced. Mitoma drove at pace to the edge of the visitors’ box, played a one‑two with the Barcelona loanee and finished neatly, low into the far corner. Half an hour later, the Japan forward doubled his individual tally, nodding in Pervis Estupiñán’s pinpoint cross from the left. It all felt a long time since Bournemouth had taken the lead in a manner that had all the hallmarks of a goalkeeping clanger, but was vindication of a Bournemouth tactical masterstroke. With the visitors refusing to press high up the pitch, Brighton’s goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen frequently resembled a conductor pleading for life from an unresponsive orchestra. Having repeatedly brought the ball out of his penalty area and waited while assessing his nonexistent options, he dawdled for too long in the 25th minute, allowing Ryan Christie to intercept and Solanke to lift over the prostrate Verbruggen into an empty net. Bournemouth had other encouraging moments, including two strong penalty shouts, the second of which – when Simon Adingra’s flailing arm struck Marcus Tavernier – left the Cherries’ manager, Andoni Iraola, particularly irate. They also twice went close in the dying stages, but remain without a Premier League win in 10 games, since beating Leeds at the end of April. “It was a tough one to accept,” Iraola said. “Especially the way we played the first half. We’ve faced really good opponents but we have to compete better.”"
Burnley,0,United,1,Bruno Fernandes stunner gives Manchester United victory at Burnley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/23/burnley-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-23,"Bruno Fernandes’s star quality: only this saved Manchester United from a fourth consecutive defeat as their patchy early season form continued. In this slump United have been shapeless, directionless, injury-plagued and forgetful of how to win. Not since Erik ten Hag’s misfiring unit reversed a 2-0 deficit to overcome Nottingham Forest 3-2 in late August have three points been theirs. Not any more: this victory was ugly and unconvincing but the manager, correctly, did not care. “This was a must-win and we knew it,” he said. “The team spoke on the pitch. You could see the characters in the dressing room. Great goal, massive, brilliant pass, brilliant movement.” It was. On his 200th United appearance, the classy Jonny Evans dropped a sweet left-footed ball into Fernandes, whose volley, from an acute angle along the right, was a ruthlessly executed picture of beauty. Under the Saturday night lights Burnley got at United – often along the flanks. Marcus Rashford tracked Connor Roberts, gave up, then saw the No 14 drop in a cross that Zeki Amdouni headed down and André Onana dived right to steer away. Next came a surge on the left from the turbo-heeled Luca Koleosho, who had Diogo Dalot felling him and entering the book. As has been the previous pattern United were easily breached. The next time Amdouni took aim it was from behind the visitors’ lines: Burnley’s centre-forward defeated Onana but not his left post and United survived. Ten Hag shuffled his depleted pack once more and came up with Hannibal Mejbri as a No 10 and the 35-year-old Evans at centre-back – the Northern Irishman filling in for Lisandro Martínez, who was the latest United man to go down (to a minor, unspecified problem). Mejbri twice played colleagues in: Rashford, who missed from near-in; and Rasmus Højlund, whose close control was clumsy, too. Evans’s first United start since a 1-0 win at Newcastle in March 2015 was first laced with disappointment when a header from Sergio Reguilón’s corner was chalked off by Tony Harrington after the referee examined the pitchside monitor. This was correct as an offside Højlund impeded James Trafford (a scenario similar to Nathan Aké’s wrongly allowed goal against Fulham, when Manuel Akanji was in the Dane’s position) but the real story was how average United were. In one phase copious passes were exchanged but a lack of imagination forced them back from Burnley territory to near goal where Onana was tapped to: the keeper hoofed upfield and the ball and moment were lost. Fernandes’s strike was the antidote to this: a finish that connected with Evans’s chip over the home rearguard and arrowed past Trafford, to his right, to give United a half-time lead. As a bedraggled band needing the succour of victory United faced a vital 45 minutes. Yet their aimless play meant Burnley remained a threat. Scott McTominay and Casemiro were ghosts, unable to control the visitors’ midfield, and the Dalot-Victor Lindelöf-Evans-Reguilón backline a half-decent home move away from being embarrassed. Best, then, to attack, and good work from McTominay and Mejbri in Burnley’s area set up Dalot for a flashing ball across the turf Højlund failed to gamble on. Yet McTominay’s next offering was a ludicrous Cruyff turn on the edge of his area straight into trouble, and Dalot’s a wild crossfield pass that went to a claret jersey and had Ten Hag stamping in fury. A better variation from United was a Rashford knock-down for Højlund that claimed a corner. But this came from a counter rather than a slick sequence of pass-and-move and with less than an hour gone United were already in a quasi-hanging-on mode. This invited Vincent Kompany’s men on and Evans’s bravery had him thwarting Jay Rodriguez while banging into Onana but each were fine. By now Reguilón had been forced off. “He was ill but wanted to play, you see the spirit in the team,” Ten Hag explained. A favoured pre-game song at Turf Moor is by Foo Fighters which has a line that runs, “it’s times like these you learn to live again”. United are just about doing so once more, but Burnley need reviving. “Our moment will come,” Kompany said. It has to – quickly."
Brentford,1,Everton,3,Calvert-Lewin’s strike sinks Brentford as Everton collect first Premier League win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/23/brentford-everton-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-23,"If the future ownership of Everton is a confused picture, there were few doubts about this being a season of struggle. Amid a highly welcome first win of the season were signs a thin squad has enough to survive, and whoever becomes their new owners might have a Premier League going concern on their hands. Though if Everton are to struggle, on the balance of their comprehensive win, the chances are Brentford, already short of Ivan Toney, now racked by an injury crisis, will be down there too. Though this was a first defeat of the season, home form has deserted them, energy levels failing to deliver the yield of the past two seasons; three points from four matches at the Community Stadium is way under par. “The first five games of the season we performed very well,” said Thomas Frank. “This was hopefully a one-off. We need to come out with a completely different mindset and performance in our next game.” As dusk descended, Everton strolled into a decisive lead, Dominic Calvert-Lewin scoring the third, and a team previously sapped in confidence was winning rather easily, against expectation. Though in the raw, energetic signing Beto, the leadership of the inspirational James Tarkowski, starring against his former club, and a powerful midfield perhaps there always was sufficient quality. “I thought it was a similar performance to ones we didn’t win in that we created chances,” said a delighted Sean Dyche. “It was a worthy win in the end.” Injuries have clearly upset the balance of Brentford, now without the excellent Rico Henry for the season. Coupled with Ben Mee’s more temporary absence with a muscle injury, a defensive reshuffle was required before Frank’s options were further reduced when a pre-match mishap ruled out Kevin Schade. To counter Brentford’s raiding full-backs, Dyche had slapped five – and considerable muscle – across the middle. James Garner’s neater distribution replacing Arnaut Danjuma was the only change from last week’s submissive loss to Arsenal. It proved highly successful as Garner excelled in a scampering role off the flanks. “I like the way he can play the game,” said Dyche. “He can adapt very well.” Everton’s strong start got its early reward. Tarkowski, booed by unforgiving Brentford fans for enforcing his 2016 move to Burnley, nodded down Garner’s cross for Abdoulaye Doucouré to score. There were multiple chances to double the lead. Beto flicked on for Dwight McNeil to fire wide, the lone Portuguese striker a constant menace. A pressured Ethan Pinnock presented Vitalii Mykolenko with a miscued clearance the Ukrainian failed to convert. Next, Doucouré almost repeated his goal by taking down Tarkowski’s lofted pass and hitting the angle. Free-flowing, almost swaggering, this was surely the best Everton had played all season. And yet, within moments of Doucouré’s miss, Brentford had their equaliser, Mathias Jensen firing beyond Jordan Pickford and off the post. Such a setback sent Everton, beyond Beto, who remained threatening, briefly back into submission mode. Sent out early, encouraged back out of their shell by their manager, Everton began the second half as strongly as the first. That Brentford retained a latent threat on the counter was the worry for Dyche and his assistants, Steve Stone and Ian Woan, with whom he remained in constant discussion. Beto flashing a header wide from another prompting Tarkowski chip proved his last contribution, with Calvert-Lewin coming on. “I’d still like to play two strikers when I can,” said Dyche. “But it’s got to suit the players.” Frank had meanwhile reconfigured his defence into a trio but a set piece – usually one of Brentford’s strong suits – proved their undoing. The boos ringing out signalled it was Tarkowski climbing highest to reach McNeil’s arrowing corner. “This is by far our worst,” admitted the Brentford captain, Christian Nørgaard. “We struggled to get to grips with the basics.” The third soon followed. Garner robbed the idling Nathan Collins and supplied Calvert-Lewin for a goal taken with considerable confidence considering the one-time England striker only scored twice in the entirety of last season. “You can see the emotion at the end with the lads and the fans,” said a smiling Calvert-Lewin. “When I came off against Aston Villa my own fans booed me off.” His relief was obvious, though if Everton are to avoid the abyss, then the unity and quality shown at Brentford must be repeated many times over."
Luton,1,Wolves,1,Carlton Morris penalty earns Luton first point of season against 10-man Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/23/luton-wolves-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-23,"When the ball left Pedro Neto’s boot and stunned silence fell on three sides of the ground, it felt like a thunderbolt had struck Kenilworth Road. After near-total dominance for Luton, Wolves, down to 10 men, were ahead, leaving their hosts facing the prospect of their most gut-wrenching defeat since their return to the top flight. The way they battled back to earn a first point of the season suggests that, for all the premature talk of relegation, it is too early to dismiss their hopes of survival. It is testament to their improvement since being blown away by Brighton in their opening game that they will feel disappointed not to have a first Premier League win. The two sides had much in common coming into this match: both had four losses to their name, had shown glimmers of promise without reward and had made a habit of creating chances without finishing them, though Wolves at least had a victory against Everton to build on. While the visitors arrived at Kenilworth Road as favourites – a given this season – their fans may have harboured bad memories: the last time Wolves visited in 2013, when they were in the Championship and Luton were still yet to escape the Conference, the home team earned a famous FA Cup upset. Luton made by far the stronger start to the game with Chiedozie Ogbene, making his first Premier League start after several impressive cameos from the bench, wreaking havoc on the left flank. Having burst into space, he teed up Alfie Doughty for a cross which fell just beyond Jacob Brown. Luton had free run of the wide areas, not least thanks to constant overlapping runs from Ogbene and Doughty, and pounded the box with a succession of crosses. With 10 minutes on the clock Carlton Morris, the scorer of their historic first Premier League goal against Brighton, lined one up from just outside the area and clattered the crossbar, raising the volume in the stands to an ear-splitting crescendo. Once again, though, Luton’s attacking ambition went unfulfilled. Wolves settled and began to assert themselves in possession, though they failed to trouble Thomas Kaminski in the home goal. Then, just as the first murmurs of anxiety rippled through the crowd, the visitors lapsed into self-sabotage. Having got into a tangle with Tom Lockyer and struggled to escape his opponent’s leg lock, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde kicked out at the Luton defender. Lockyer crumpled and Bellegarde’s fate was sealed, the sting of being sent off only worsened when, after waiting with his hands on his hips for the result of a VAR check, he was waved off to a chorus of boos as the original decision stood. Wolves held on until the break, turtling up as Luton swarmed them. The hosts went back to a familiar theme after half-time, Ogbene racing down the left again and crossing to Morris for a close-range header that was saved by José Sá. With Wolves switching to a back five after the departure of Hwang Hee-chan for Toti Gomes, the two sides looked set for a game of textbook attack-versus-defence. It was just then, with the home side gearing up for an all-out assault, that Wolves delivered the counter-punch: Neto beat Lockyer to the ball out wide, cut inside, rounded Reece Burke and left the net bulging. The explosion of noise from the away fans reverberated beneath the corrugated iron roof of the Oak Road End. In the Main Stand, home supporters sat with arms folded or shook their heads in disbelief. Then came the sudden roar, the volume rising once again. Luton responded, refusing to give up on the goal that eluded them. In the end, they drew level thanks to a lucky break when a cross bounced up off João Gomes’s foot and hit his outstretched arm. Josh Smith, the referee, awarded a contentious penalty – Gary O’Neil, the Wolves manager, called it “a terrible decision” given the heavy deflection – which Morris duly slotted away, unleashing a crashing wave of relief. The home fans thought they tasted victory when Ogbene got in behind and rolled the ball into the back of the net, but the offside flag cut their celebrations short. “There’s loads we can improve on,” said Rob Edwards, the Luton manager, afterwards. “We’ve still got a long way to go to get to where I want us to be.” Even so, Luton’s losing start is over and, having picked themselves up off the canvas, they have shown the will to keep fighting."
Palace,0,Fulham,0,Johnstone denies Fulham as Crystal Palace frustrated in goalless draw,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/23/crystal-palace-fulham-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-23,"You have to admire Roy Hodgson. A week after being taken to hospital after falling ill before Crystal Palace’s game against Aston Villa last weekend, the former England manager watched almost every minute of this arm wrestle of a match standing on the edge of his technical area as two evenly-matched teams played out a stalemate. On an afternoon that saw Fulham again show their lack of cutting edge in attack since the departure of Aleksandar Mitrovic, Palace were indebted to goalkeeper Sam Johnstone for keeping Marco Silva’s side out with a string of excellent saves. Only Eberechi Eze – making his 100th appearance for Palace – looked capable of unpicking a stubborn Fulham defence but ultimately no one could find the breakthrough in a game between two sides who look destined for mid-table again. “I was very touched by the concern,” said Hodgson. “But if you ask me how I’m feeling then I’m not feeling as good as I was before the game because I was hoping for a victory.” Hodgson admitted that the rigorous tests he was put through at hospital last weekend had made him “more confident than ever I can be out on that field a little bit longer” despite celebrating his 76th birthday last month. But while the return of Marc Guéhi to the heart of the Palace defence after conceding three late goals to Villa in their manager’s absence ensured they remain ahead of Fulham on goal difference, it was Silva who was more frustrated after failing to add to their meagre tally of five goals this season. “We were the team that created more chances to win – we have to be more effective in attack,” said the Fulham manager, adding that Raúl Jiménez’s first goal for the club should be “only a matter of time” despite the Mexican spurning a good chance here. Carlos Vinícius had to make do with a place on the bench again despite sealing the narrow victory over Luton last week, with Jiménez starting in attack and rarely troubling Guéhi and Joachim Andersen in Palace’s defence. An incisive move down the left flank involving Antonee Robinson and Willian set up Andreas Pereira for the first sight of goal inside the opening five minutes but Johnstone was equal to his shot. The Palace goalkeeper was called upon again to tip away Willian’s drive from distance as Fulham showed their intent. Two bookings in the space of five minutes for João Palhinha and Tim Ream lifted the atmosphere among the home supporters as Palace began to find their feet, although Jordan Ayew could have no complaints after he was shown a yellow card for clattering into the Portuguese midfielder. The scrappy first half fare certainly wouldn’t have impressed the former Fulham striker Rodney Marsh who was watching up in the stands as both sides seemed to cancel each other out in spite of the frenetic pace. Eze finally recorded Palace’s first shot on target from a free-kick just after the half-hour mark before Jiménez was presented with the best chance of the half thanks to Pereira’s brilliant pass, only to be denied by another good save from Johnstone. Hodgson had the perfect view when Eze curled an effort just wide of the post after a mazy dribble. A rare mistake from the reliable Ream almost gifted Palace the perfect start to the second half but Will Hughes directed his shot into the hands of Bernd Leno. Eze thought he was in the clear after Cheick Doucouré’s timely interception, only for Palhinha to come from nowhere and stop him in his tracks. Referee Paul Tierney then waved away strong appeals from the home crowd when Eze went down in the box after a challenge from Harrison Reed. Fulham had not offered much in attack since the early exchanges until Hughes was dispossessed in midfield but there was no one to apply the finish to Jiménez’s ball across the face of goal. Hodgson decided to go for broke with the introduction of Jean-Philippe Mateta off the bench to partner Odsonne Édouard in attack, while Silva waited until 10 minutes before the end before calling for Vinícius. But it was Willian who produced the best save of the afternoon from Johnstone’s legs after the Brazilian found some space on the left-hand side, with Mateta’s dribbling shot at the other end that was easily gathered by Leno summing up a frustrating afternoon for Palace."
City,2,Forest,0,Haaland steers Manchester City past Nottingham Forest despite Rodri red,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/23/manchester-city-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-23,"It all seemed so sedate for Manchester City against Nottingham Forest. They were two goals ahead and Rodri, the man who makes them tick in midfield, was his cerebral self until he erupted with anger to get sent off for violent conduct within 60 seconds of the second half beginning. City had one player fewer for nearly an entire half but the result was never in doubt thanks to goals from Phil Foden and Erling Haaland. It will, however, leave Pep Guardiola to ponder the cost of losing Rodri for three matches, including a trip to Arsenal. “Hopefully Rodri will learn,” Guardiola said, confirming that the Spaniard had apologised to his teammates. “The game was perfect [for] 35 minutes, both teams tried and after that it became a little bit chaotic. That wasn’t our responsibility, that’s for sure. “But Rodri had to control himself and his emotions. Because I can get a yellow card but Rodri can’t get a yellow card – I don’t play. The guys who were inside [the pitch], you have to be careful.” By the time Foden cannoned Kyle Walker’s knock-back, aided by a clever Rodri pass, into the bottom corner in the seventh minute, Forest had touched the ball twice and one of those was a Matt Turner save from a Julián Álvarez free-kick. Steve Cooper had set his team up with a flat back five behind four midfielders to try to stop the hosts scoring and they did not come close to answering the many questions posed by City’s domination of possession. There were 46 passes in the buildup to the opener, the second-most since records began in 2005. Despite the fact there were always 10 men behind the ball, Forest’s attempts at resistance were beyond futile. Smart play between Foden and Matheus Nunes allowed the Portuguese to chip the ball to the back post for an unmarked Haaland to head home his eighth league goal of the campaign. Considering Forest had three centre-backs on the pitch to leave Haaland by himself was unforgivable, but the team as a whole could not cope with City’s speed and movement. The classic battle of blue against red gave the impression of a Subbuteo match, aided by the static nature of the Forest defence. “A really poor start,” Cooper said. “We know the level of the challenge against City here. It doesn’t get any tougher. But if you look at the two goals, it’s great quality but they are typical City goals. We planned for that, a repeated tactic, but to let it happen so easily is disappointing. I wanted them to score with real difficulty.” Guardiola was annoyed by Anthony Taylor, saying he “changed the game”. The referee was the busiest man inside the Etihad, handing out 11 yellow cards including one for the City manager – seven of them to Forest players – in addition to the solitary red. City were in control but Taiwo Awoniyi broke away and was adjudged to be fouled by Manuel Akanji. The centre-back and his manager were cautioned, the latter for complaining to the officials that Willy Boly had committed a similar foul without being rebuked by Taylor. “It’s not fair,” Guardiola said. “Why is this action not a yellow card and the other one is? I ask the officials to give me the reason why and they don’t give me a reason.” The booking did not deter Guardiola who continued to berate the fourth official, Dean Whitestone. He might be in charge of a side with a perfect record this season but that does not calm his view on injustice against his team and it perhaps set the tone on the pitch at the same time. There was a sense of complacency within the City ranks after the second went in. Sloppy mistakes were made, much to Guardiola’s annoyance. To make up for the slack nature of the final stages of the first half, City came out fired up, none more so than Rodri who was soon back in the dressing room after being sent off for an altercation with Morgan Gibbs-White. There was some pushing, shoving and head-to-head action, ending in mild farce when Gibbs-White threw himself to the ground after being grabbed around the neck. Taylor deemed it worthy of a sending off and VAR saw no reason to disagree after a lengthy review. The second half was aggressive and scrappy, not a situation City are often in but they were composed enough to deal with the situation. Cooper sent on the pace of Callum Hudson-Odoi and Anthony Elanga as he looked to perform death by a thousand crosses on City but they easily held firm, with Ederson finally tested in the 95th minute to no avail as the hosts continued their perfect start."
Forest,1,Burnley,1,Nottingham Forest and VAR deny Burnley win after Hudson-Odoi stunner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/18/nottingham-forest-burnley-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-18,"Burnley may have registered their first point of the season with this draw at Nottingham Forest to avoid the ignominy of a fourth straight league defeat but they will feel aggrieved at not claiming victory after Lyle Foster’s second-half goal was controversially ruled out after a VAR review. To compound things Foster was sent off via the video screen in stoppage time for elbowing Ryan Yates. The Burnley substitute Sander Berge was deemed to have used his forearm to control the ball before Foster converted his cutback from the edge of the six-yard box. The ball bounced off the top of Berge’s left arm as he kept Scott McKenna at bay but, tellingly, the Forest defender made no complaint to the referee, Robert Jones, as Foster wheeled away in celebration. McKenna had made a hash of a pass over the top of the Forest defence, ending up on all fours after slipping and presenting Berge with the chance to pile into the box and pass to Foster, who swept the ball in from close range. But as soon as the referee headed for the VAR monitor there was a groundswell of cheers from the home support. The Forest fans knew what was coming but those of a Burnley persuasion were not quite so enamoured with the call. At least from the officials’ perspective, the chances of them getting an ear-bashing from Vincent Kompany anytime soon seems unlikely. “I have a decent business brain and a decent coaching brain but when it comes to the laws and the legalities, I switch off,” he said. “I’ve made a decision to just trust that they know what they’re doing and they have the right intentions. It is not something I want to discuss because I cannot change it.” These teams duelled at this stadium in the Carabao Cup 19 days before this game but only six players from the starting lineups then also began this fixture: three Forest and Burnley players apiece. Were it not for the late drama, the discourse would have been dominated by Callum Hudson-Odoi’s magnificent debut strike, a divine, curling effort. It ultimately earned Forest a point after Zeki Amdouni had struck with a wonderful effort of his own, smacking a first-time shot into the bottom corner after the 19-year-old Luca Koleosho scooted past Joe Worrall and to the byline. Hudson-Odoi’s only other appearance in a Forest shirt came a fortnight ago for the under-21s in contrasting surrounds: an hour in a Papa John’s Trophy defeat at Harrogate Town. If Amdouni’s strike was clean, then Hudson-Odoi’s was a pure thing of beauty. Taiwo Awoniyi did superbly to get a floated cross under his spell under pressure from Johann Gudmundsson – the video assistant referee, Darren England, cleared the Forest striker’s close control for handball – and located Hudson-Odoi on the edge of the box. He shifted the ball on to his right foot and promptly bent a sumptuous effort towards goal, an unerring finish that kissed the far post on its final descent into the Burnley net. Hudson-Odoi reunited with Steve Cooper, his manager when England won the Under-17 World Cup six years ago, after a deadline-day move from Chelsea for an initial £3m, which seemed a snip long before his fine leveller here. “It was a beautiful strike, beautiful technique,” the Forest head coach said. “I know he has quality, I know he can have moments of brilliance and you need that at times in the Premier League. It will be great for him and it was great for us, obviously.” Kompany’s diplomacy was admirable but perhaps it was easier to cut a relaxed figure because of how his team, pointless at the outset, had performed. Kompany picked out Charlie Taylor, who until this trip had not made a match-day squad in the league this season. Amdouni was relentless and Koleosho proved so problematic for the World Cup winner Gonzalo Montiel that Cooper introduced Nuno Tavares and moved Ola Aina to right-back in an attempt to tame the winger who was part of the Italy side that lifted the European Under-19 Championship in the summer. Burnley were on the back foot for the first half an hour, before Amdouni forced Matt Turner into a plunging save, but even after the disappointment of the disallowed goal they finished strongly. “It is fair to say it was a dramatic game,” Kompany said. “This journey for us is not easy but we can grow.”"
Everton,0,Arsenal,1,Leandro Trossard gives resilient Arsenal first victory at Everton in six years,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/17/everton-arsenal-premier-league-match-,2023-09-17,"Arsenal picked a good place to showcase the determination, belief and class required to produce another Premier League title challenge. Mikel Arteta’s team were confronted by an obstinate Everton with zero ambition but one piercing move and stylish finish from the substitute Leandro Trossard sufficed for a first win at Goodison Park in almost six years. It was another galling afternoon for Sean Dyche as his side succumbed to a third 1-0 defeat in three home matches this season. A struggling Everton have lost four of their opening five games for the first time since 2005-06 and the manager can be thankful that the wantaway owner Farhad Moshiri is unlikely to contemplate another change at the top. Everton’s performances do not warrant such talk, overall, but their woeful run of results would have undoubtedly tested Moshiri’s patience back in the day when he had the resources and ambition to demand better. Dyche seemed intent on a goalless draw from the outset. It was Arsenal’s patience that was ultimately tested here and they passed as comfortably as the move that brought victory. From a short corner, too. Everton won the corresponding fixture from a more direct corner last season in Dyche’s first game. The contrasting approach speaks volumes. Arsenal had lost four and drawn one of their previous five visits to Goodison but there appears more substance to Arteta’s team this season, and it was required to maintain the confidence and composure to eventually break Everton. There were boos after the final whistle for only four minutes of time being added on. The truth is, the hosts would not have threatened an equaliser no matter how long the referee, Simon Hooper, played. “There is massive work to be done, as I said at the end of last season,” the Everton manager said. “I thought we would have had more points on the board than we have because the performances deserve more but the table doesn’t lie. You can’t give the ball away as often as we did today. We were not effective enough.” There was a notable absence from the Arsenal side as Aaron Ramsdale was replaced in goal by David Raya for the first time since the Spaniard’s loan move from Brentford. The debutant could not have wished for a gentler introduction, spending the entirety of the game as a virtual spectator as Everton sat back and allowed Arsenal to dominate possession. Had Dyche calculated that his team could absorb pressure, close the gaps that Arsenal look to exploit and kill the spectacle, he was proven correct by a tedious first half. There was sympathy for Beto, Everton’s recent signing from Udinese, who was completely isolated on his home debut by both the gameplan and his teammates’ tendency to lose possession almost immediately. The only incident of note before the break was the VAR decision to disallow a strike from Gabriel Martinelli. It was the only time Arsenal managed to breach a well-organised Everton defence, but another VAR intervention that was open to interpretation. A Beto challenge on Gabriel Magalhães sent the ball sailing towards the Everton goal, where Eddie Nketiah came from an offside position to collect. The impressive Fábio Vieira then released Martinelli behind the converted right-back Ashley Young and the Brazilian found the far corner with a pinpoint finish. VAR, however, decided that Beto’s touch was accidental and the celebrations inside Goodison switched from the away corner to the home sections as the breakthrough was ruled out for an offside against Nketiah. It was a reprieve for Everton and a relief for Amadou Onana, who had let Beto’s ball run through to the otherwise anonymous Arsenal striker in the correct belief that he was off. Arsenal were otherwise comfortably contained before the interval. Injury was added to insult for Martinelli when he hobbled off with a muscular problem moments later, to be replaced by Trossard, and the visitors spent the remainder of the half searching in vain for a way through the nine royal blue shirts encamped deep inside their own half. The interval brought welcome respite for the spectator and time for Arteta to work on a solution. His players delivered. There was greater urgency, better movement and combinations from the visitors as soon as the contest restarted. Everton players were suddenly dragged out of position as Arsenal overloads on both flanks brought an overdue threat to Jordan Pickford’s clean sheet. The England goalkeeper denied Martin Ødegaard after the Arsenal captain collected Ben White’s incisive pass and cut inside Jarrad Branthwaite. The young Everton centre-half produced a fine clearance to prevent Trossard’s dangerous low cross reaching Bukayo Saka, while the commanding James Tarkowski stopped Nketiah’s drive into the box with a pristine tackle. But the pressure was increasing, and finally told when Arsenal produced an exquisite move from a corner and Trossard applied the finishing touch it deserved. Vieira and Ødegaard combined to release Saka towards the right‑hand byline. Saka pulled the ball back at pace towards the Belgium international who steered an unstoppable first-time shot beyond Pickford and in off the far post. It was no more than Arsenal deserved, and the reward for a gruelling slog."
Bournemouth,0,Chelsea,0,Raheem Sterling goes close but Chelsea struggle again in Bournemouth draw,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/17/bournemouth-chelsea-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-17,"For Mauricio Pochettino, it was just not possible to sell this as a hard-luck story, although he would try. His Chelsea team dominated possession, they played on the front foot and they had plenty of possibilities in their approach work. But there remains something missing in what he is trying to create out of the chaos of the summer transfer window. Quite simply, it is aggression and conviction – particularly in the final third, when the pressure is really on. It was hard to say that anybody in Chelsea’s colours had played well – maybe apart from the stand-in captain, Conor Gallagher. There were too many fives and sixes in the ratings, nobody who stamped his authority on proceedings and it came as no surprise that there were boos from the travelling fans upon the full-time whistle. When Ben Chilwell, on as a substitute, went over to them, he found himself in the crosshairs. After four points from the opening four matches, Chelsea needed a win, something that represented a spark. Instead, there was only frustration. Raheem Sterling hit the underside of the crossbar with a free-kick at the start of the second half but there were not too many regrets in terms of glaring missed chances. Chelsea threatened yet only in a vague and increasingly empty sort of way. Bournemouth will take the point, especially as they were in containment mode for the majority, although they did almost nick something late on as things became more open, Chelsea pushing with increasing desperation. The substitute Justin Kluivert made a difference and Dominic Solanke had a couple of sightings against his former club, the first on 79 minutes when he rammed a low shot at goal. Robert Sánchez saved smartly with a foot. What Pochettino wanted to highlight was the long list of injured and unavailable players; it was up to 12 here, Moisés Caicedo (knee), Marc Cucurella (illness) and Noni Madueke (muscular) the latest additions. Chelsea might have spent around a billion pounds on new signings under the ownership of Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali but nothing can insulate a manager from this volume of absentees. He had only three players on the bench who had kicked a ball for the club. Pochettino’s related point was that Chelsea’s lavish spend had created a level of expectation that was impossible to live up to while he was, essentially, punching with one hand behind his back. Moreover, there were many young players from overseas who needed to be assimilated. And yet it still felt that he had enough on the pitch to get the better of Bournemouth, who are yet to win in the league under Andoni Iraola. Everybody connected to Chelsea had stewed since the Nottingham Forest defeat before the international break and there will be more of the same this week before the visit of Aston Villa on Sunday. “Attack, attack, attack,” the Chelsea support chanted on 37 minutes, even though their team had done so and enjoyed moments. It spoke to general angst, which was encapsulated by Mykhailo Mudryk, who Pochettino had started on the left wing ahead of Chilwell. Mudryk had flickers and he could reflect that he set up two chances for Gallagher in the first half; the second being the clear one. When Mudryk’s pass ran through to Gallagher and he turned Ryan Christie, he had to score. He shot too close to Neto. Mudryk also won the free-kick for the Sterling chance. In the debit column for the Ukrainian were a number of hesitant decisions, mainly involving when to release the ball; weak work out of possession and a yellow card for a late tackle. The hard truth was that he was uncomfortable to watch at times, although he was not alone. Nicolas Jackson laboured up front while Enzo Fernández was ineffective. He infuriated the away fans when he practically walked off when he was substituted. Chelsea’s buildup play showed promise at the outset. Gallagher drove with purpose while Sterling was quick and sharp. The end product, though, was absent. Jackson hit the outside of the post with a low shot on 14 minutes that he appeared to scuff but the big chance of the first half was at the other end. Bournemouth worked a quick free‑kick and Pochettino felt his blood run hot when his players switched off. Christie crossed and there was Dango Ouattara stealing in at the far post. Sánchez made a fine block to deny him. Sterling’s free-kick bounced down off the crossbar, on to the line and away and, when Levi Colwill converted the rebound, he was flagged offside. Cole Palmer, who came on for Mudryk, worked Neto, with another substitute, Ian Maatsen, seeing the follow-up blocked and at least Chelsea were not ambushed. Philip Billing wasted a free-kick on the edge of the area while Solanke could not find a finish."
Newcastle,1,Brentford,0,Wilson proves point to see off Brentford and get Newcastle back on track,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/16/newcastle-brentford-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-16,"Where would Newcastle be without Callum Wilson? In three years on Tyneside the England striker has scored 41 goals in 80 appearances, playing a key role in a couple of relegation escapes before helping secure Champions League qualification in May. Without Wilson here, Newcastle’s winless run could very easily have stretched to four matches. Instead his impeccably converted, if controversially awarded, second-half penalty proved a rare moment of perfection, camouflaging the series of fast‑developing faultlines running through a side quite possibly distracted by an impending European adventure. “It was an even game,” said Brentford’s manager, Thomas Frank, who suggested Anthony Gordon collapsed far too easily in the face of fleeting contact from his goalkeeper, Mark Flekken. “We did so many things right, our performance was very impressive and we could have won. That’s why it’s frustrating it was decided by a decision I think was wrong. “I don’t normally complain about penalties but we have a keeper clearly pulling out of making a challenge and a player cleverly leaving his leg in.” Much as Newcastle fans discovered the logistics of travelling to Milan for Tuesday’s opening Champions League group stage game to be somewhat trickier than expected, Eddie Howe’s players are finding the Premier League infinitely tougher going than envisaged. While an absence of direct flights from the north-east to Italy’s fashion capital dictate that those supporters must make complicated and costly connections, Newcastle kicked off here on the back of three straight league defeats. Given that they suffered only five in the whole of last season, Howe’s team began in slightly dazed and confused mode. As Brentford counterattacked with speed and incision, the tactical buttons Bruno Guimarães and company pressed with instinctive ease as they cantered to fourth place last term suddenly seemed to be sticking. When Newcastle were not struggling to cope with the impressive Mathias Jensen’s intelligent midfield manoeuvres they struggled to deconstruct Brentford’s meticulously organised five-man defence. Almost half an hour had passed before Flekken was called to arms. When Kieran Trippier’s corner reached Guimarães, the latterly out of sorts Brazilian headed downwards, forcing Brentford’s goalkeeper to save smartly with his feet. With Joelinton sidelined by a knee injury and thigh trouble keeping Sandro Tonali on the bench, Sean Longstaff and Elliot Anderson were offered rare starts in the home midfield but found themselves largely eclipsed by Jensen and friends. Brentford, though, failed to make the most of a couple of decent early chances on the break – most notably when Nick Pope denied Aaron Hickey – and were disrupted when Rico Henry sustained a potentially serious looking knee injury after tangling with Trippier. Given the left wing-back’s excellence during his side’s unbeaten start to the season that represented quite a blow for Frank – not to mention a player in contention for an England call-up. Without Henry, Brentford were less imaginative but last season’s ferocious Newcastle press was clearly malfunctioning. Maybe Howe is missing the injured Joe Willock more than he imagined. Newcastle’s manager had restored Wilson to his starting XI, dropping Alexander Isak to the bench, and Wilson appeared to have repaid his manager’s faith by bundling the ball into the net after a 58th-minute goalmouth scramble. Much to the home side’s disgust that effort was disallowed for Wilson’s perceived foul on the arguably fortunate goalkeeper but, six minutes later, the England striker made no mistake from the penaltyspot. This time Flekken, played into trouble by Hickey’s ill-advised back pass, intervened to halt Gordon’s progress but, perhaps realising the winger was heading away from goal, retreated following minimal contact. Even so, Gordon crashed to earth and Wilson’s immaculate penalty soon sailed beyond Flekken’s reach. Newcastle might have had a second spot-kick but a VAR review convinced Craig Pawson to overturn his initial decision to award another penalty for handball against Bryan Mbeumo. No matter; Wilson had already done enough to both justify his new contract extension and avert Howe’s first mini crisis at the St James’ helm. “It was a massive win for us,” said Newcastle’s manager. “It wasn’t us at our free-flowing best but it means we can enjoy Milan that little bit more.”"
Villa,3,Palace,1,Late Aston Villa treble seals dramatic comeback win over Crystal Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/16/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-16,"This was not the perfect victory but Aston Villa made it 10 out of 10 wins at home by recovering from going behind to gain all three points thanks to three goals scored after the 87th minute. In a crazy end to a game Villa deserved to win but had almost thrown away, Jhon Durán equalised, Douglas Luiz scored a delayed penalty eight minutes into added time and Leon Bailey added a third. Crystal Palace did everything they could to provide their absent manager, Roy Hodgson, with a tonic as they sought to extend their unbeaten away start to the season thanks to Odsonne Édouard’s goal early in the second half. With their manager taken ill on the morning of the game and obliged to stay away with what a Palace spokesperson said was “a private medical matter”, his team survived a Villa onslaught in the first half to gain the upper hand, Édouard converting Jean-Philippe Mateta’s cross for his fourth Premier League goal of the season. Villa, though, are the third-best team in the country this year, with only Manchester City and Arsenal having won more Premier League games in 2023. They never stopped believing, even when Ollie Watkins’s shot rebounded off a post, back off the head of the goalkeeper, Sam Johnstone, and out for a corner. In the 87th minute, Durán chested down Lucas Digne’s cross from the left before unleashing a howitzer of a half-volley beyond Johnstone, who had earlier required treatment. The game was eight minutes into the nine allocated for added time when Youri Tielemans put Watkins in on goal and the referee, Darren England, gave a penalty for Chris Richards’s challenge. The video assistant referee sent England to the dugout to review the incident but while replays suggested the defender may have got a sliver of the top of the ball before upending Watkins, it was hardly a clear and obvious error to award the penalty. Going against the grain, but staying true to his judgment, the referee deserves credit. Douglas Luiz sent Johnstone the wrong way to make it 2-1 and with Palace not surprisingly totally out of shape as they frantically threw men forward in a bid for an unlikely equaliser, Moussa Diaby broke down the left and crossed for Bailey to score again. Douglas Luiz has now scored in four successive home games in the Premier League, the first Villa played to do since Gareth Barry in 2006. Villa can jet off to Poland in high spirits, as they start their Europa Conference League group action against Legia Warsaw, while Palace are left to lick their wounds. Palace, who lost Jordan Ayew to injury in the first half after Marc Guéhi had failed to recover from the muscle injury he collected on England duty, made light of their absentees to play with heart, organisation and, on the counterattack, no little creativity, with Eberechi Eze again a stylish outlet. The Palace fans sang ‘Roy Hodgson, he’s one of our own’ and their togetherness is testimony to their manager. Paddy McCarthy, his assistant, said his absence did not affect the team’s plans: “All the preparations were done,” he said. “It was between breakfast and the pre-match meal he felt a bit unwell. We had some communication with him before the game but with the game going on it was difficult. I’ll be looking to speak to him now.” With Palace leading, Unai Emery reacted with increasingly attacking substitutions and when Bailey showed great skill to weave down the right and cross, Durán’s shot was saved after Douglas Luiz headed the ball down for him. “Sometimes we have to use our heart, use our passions and we needed as well the referee giving us [something],” the Villa manager said. “We played a different way but we deserved to win.” Palace could have sealed victory in the 82nd minute. Martínez saved, however, as Eze, ghosting in on goal, almost lifted the ball over the keeper. That left Villa to make their breakthrough, Durán smashing in his third goal for the club in all competitions. Now for Europe."
Spurs,2,Sheffield,1,Kulusevski’s late late show steals Tottenham win over Sheffield United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/16/tottenham-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-16,"Some things in life are guaranteed. Manor Solomon, given the chance to run at an opponent, will cut infield into his right foot. James Maddison, challenged in the box, will go to ground, sit up and spread his arms while looking plaintively at the referee. And Tottenham, just as optimism is beginning to sprout, will find a way to lose. Or will they? Perhaps this is the true measure of what Ange Postecoglou has achieved: it took 15 minutes of injury-time, but from somewhere Spurs found two late goals to win a game that had seemed lost. And so the scene, when the final whistle was blown, was of extraordinary jubilation, players swinging off the crossbar, a crowd in raptures and Postecoglou being serenaded with a mass singalong to Robbie Williams. It was probably all a bit much for a 2-1 victory over Sheffield United, but this was about as far from a regulation win as it is possible to get; no side has been behind later in a Premier League game and gone on to win. The most remarkable aspect of the comeback, though, was not even its lateness, but that it was sparked by Richarlison. The Brazilian had previously scored one league goal since joining from Everton for £60m in the summer of 2022 and had revealed over the international break he has been receiving psychological help for his struggles with off-field events. But he headed the equaliser before laying on the winner for Dejan Kulusevski. “Richy was great,” said Postecoglou. “You try to maintain a balance in life. His football hasn’t been that bad but sometimes when you struggle in certain parts of your life it goes into other areas. He got his rewards today, hopefully that goes into other areas and hopefully a day like today will help him.” He was keen to stress that he did not know too much about the specifics of Richarlison’s difficulties and had not been asking questions or offering advice, preferring to leave that to the people at the club “who are far more qualified” to do so. “My role,” Postecoglou said, “is to provide an environment to hopefully feel secure in this part of his life. We’ve a great group of players. They’ve been round him and you could see at the end how happy they were for him.” One of the most impressive aspects of Postecoglou’s short reign at Spurs has been his capacity to make substitutions that have had a positive effect. Against Manchester United and Bournemouth a couple of changes headed off possible fightbacks almost before they had begun. Here, the job was to kindle imagination that had seemingly been snuffed out and he achieved it by introducing Richarlison and the new signing Brennan Johnson. It had not seemed as though it was going to end like that. We’d seen this Tottenham performance before. The longer the game went on, the more Tottenham ran out of ideas, the more frustration mounted, the more probable an away goal became. Even the manner of it had a certain inevitability, as Jack Robinson’s long throw looped over everybody and came to Gustavo Hamer at the back of the box. Taking it on the bounce, the Brazilian steered his second goal since last month’s move from Coventry in off the far post. It says much for how Postecoglou has changed the mood that the crowd stayed with Spurs. It is easy to imagine how toxic the atmosphere would have been at 1-0 down six months ago; what anger and frustration there was, though, was directed largely at the referee, Peter Bankes, and his inability to deal with what might euphemistically be called Sheffield United’s game management. As it turned out, the added minutes worked in Spurs’ favour. “I’m gutted for everyone in that dressing room,” said Sheffield United’s manager, Paul Heckingbottom. “That’s how cruel the game can be but the result doesn’t change the performance.” That is seven points lost this season to goals conceded after the 88th minute but here especially they will wonder how on earth, having defended so well and for so long, they ended up with nothing but a very late red card for Oli McBurnie, but the force of the Postecoglou revolution is not to be denied."
Fulham,1,Luton,0,Fulham’s Vinícius extends Luton’s pursuit of first Premier League point,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/16/fulham-luton-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-16,"They came more in hope than expectation. But while Luton’s wait for a first Premier League point goes on after substitute Carlos Vinícius secured Fulham’s first home win of the season, the away supporters still have plenty of reason to feel optimistic despite now sitting bottom. Having conceded nine goals in their first three matches at the top table, this was a markedly improved performance from Luton as it took until midway through the second half for Fulham to find the breakthrough within minutes of Vinícius’s introduction off the bench. Up to that point, it had been the visitors who had created the better chances after weathering an early storm, with Jacob Brown and Amari’i Bell spurning excellent opportunities. “I’m very proud of the lads – we were in the game until the very last minute,” said Rob Edwards. “We had three great chances and I could be in here talking about us taking something from the game. We’re disappointed but I’ve seen progression again from a couple of weeks ago.” Edwards had been stung by criticism from Garth Crooks after the BBC pundit said this week he “can’t take them seriously” and tipped Luton to be relegated by Christmas. The former Tottenham striker has since been invited to take part in a training session, although Edwards acknowledged he has more important things to worry about. Fulham, who paid tribute to their former chairman Mohamed Al Fayed, who died last month at the age of 94, with a scarf-whirling welcome before kick off, were relieved to hang on in the end thanks largely to a dominant display from João Palhinha on his first appearance since a last-ditch transfer to Bayern Munich fell through. Palhinha extended his contract until 2028 on Friday to provide some relief at last for Marco Silva after a difficult summer for Fulham as they lost top scorer Aleksandr Mitrovic to Saudi Arabia. “Since the first minute that he joined the club, João has been excellent for us and he showed it again today,” said Silva. “I’ve never had doubts about his commitment.” Having finally avoided immediate relegation back down to the Championship at the third attempt last season as they exceeded all expectations by finishing 10th, on this evidence, it may be more of a struggle without the Serbia striker despite the quality remaining at Silva’s disposal. Mitrovic’s replacement, Raúl Jiménez, offered little in attack apart from an attempted overhead kick that led to Fulham’s first real opportunity after 20 minutes as Kenny Tete headed over a corner from close range. Luton’s defensive doggedness and team spirit has driven their rapid climb up the leagues and they seemed to grow in confidence as the first half continued. A last-gasp challenge from Palhinha stopped a counterattack in its tracks before a brilliant cross from Issa Kaboré was headed against the post by Brown. The Luton goalkeeper, Thomas Kaminski, managed to get himself booked for timewasting in the 36th minute as Fulham ended the half having racked up almost 80% in possession but little to show for it in terms of cutting edge. Only Bell will know how he failed to provide the breakthrough within seconds of the restart after Brown picked out the left wing-back unmarked on the back post, with Bernd Leno well positioned to make the save from point-blank range. Fulham responded by picking up where they had left off in the first half in terms of dominating the ball and Palhinha’s header drifted just over the crossbar as they mounted the pressure. Luton stuck to their gameplan as they camped out midway in their own half and dared their opponents to try to break them down on a sweltering afternoon by the Thames. Silva opted to play his hand early by introducing debutant Alex Iwobi and Vinícius off the bench in the 62nd minute and it paid off almost immediately. Willian found some space down the left flank and his teasing ball caught Kaminski in two minds as he could only palm the ball straight into the path of Vinícius, who made no mistake with an instinctive finish. Willian went close to extending their lead as Fulham smelled blood but Luton refused to give up without a fight as Kaboré’s shot was deflected wide to end the day with nothing to show for their concerted effort."
West Ham,1,City,3,Silva and Haaland seal Manchester City’s comeback win at West Ham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/16/west-ham-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-16,"For 45 minutes on a clammy day in east London, a compact and enterprising West Ham seemed to be giving Manchester City their toughest test of the Premier League season so far, a goal up and coiled behind a quick-breaking attack. By the final knockings of the second half the scene was more familiar. The City fans were pogoing about happily in the away end. Erling Haaland had finally scored a goal, after almost scoring a goal more times than seemed humanly possible in a single game of football. And City were romping towards their fifth straight league win of the season, 3-1 up and on the verge of returning to the top of the table. In between Pep Guardiola’s team were indebted to a fine, incisive performance from Jérémy Doku on the left, providing the ball-carrying ability lost by the departure of Riyad Mahrez, and an excellent all-round display from Julián Álvarez. West Ham had played well, with Edson Álvarez and Lucas Paquetá holding their own at times in midfield. But somehow there always seemed to be other gears, other angles for the champions. At the end David Moyes put his team’s defeat down to “small margins”. Frankly, City just look at least a couple of levels up on every other team in the league. The air inside the London Stadium was heavy with end-of-summer heat all afternoon. Before kick-off Paolo Di Canio had come bowling out on to the field waving his arms before unexpectedly breaking into I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles, crooner style. The response was perhaps less feral than he might have hoped, verging more towards mild surprise. And in the opening moments City began like a team intent not just on victory but on wiping every memory of West Ham off the map. With six minutes gone Alphonse Areola made three close-range saves in the space of 10 seconds, with two other shots at goal also blocked as City took it in turns to machine gun the West Ham goal. With 14 minutes gone Doku combined well with Josko Gvardiol. His cross found Haaland completely unmarked (how?) at the back post. He smashed the ball not just wide, but miles wide with his left foot. With Bernardo Silva the other half of the double-pivot in midfield, City always had a free agent in possession. Behind this having four centre-backs in defence didn’t work as well as it has. Gvardiol looked uncomfortable at times trying to conduct the possession in attack. And it was down his side that West Ham broke away to score the opening goal. It was an excellent move begun by Jarrod Bowen, cutting out Gvardiol with a lovely reverse pass to Vladimir Coufal. He galloped unimpeded down the right, waited a beat, then lifted the perfect cross for James Ward-Prowse to dive full-length and nod the ball into the corner of the net. Haaland might have made it 1-1 on 41 minutes after more excellent work from Doku, pirouetting into space on the left and whipping a low cross that the striker met with a weak touch at the far post, the ball eventually kicked away by Edson Álvarez. It took Doku 41 seconds of the second half to equalise. It was all a little too easy. Haaland dropped deep and the ball was fed wide from his lay-back out to Doku, who finally had Coufal isolated, with the right angle to cut in towards goal. He made it look laughably easy, waggling his hips in full flight to throw Coufal one way, then in his next stride curling the ball into the far corner, a wonderful finish for his first City goal. “We played him in pre-season and he caused us a problem then, he’s very direct,” Moyes said. “He was a handful all game.” City were once again all over West Ham like a heavy weather front. Rodri smashed a shot from a free-kick on to the post. Haaland drew a clawing save from Areola with a flying, running scissor volley. Faced with this pressure West Ham were happy to live without the ball and take their moments on the break. From a rare corner Ederson reminded the world that he is also very good at the stuff that involves his hands, diving to make a fine save from Kurt Zouma’s header. The departure of Edson Álvarez, who had already been booked and had arrived home at 4am after a Wednesday international for Mexico in Atlanta, left the midfield a little more open. With 70 minutes gone City had already taken 25 shots to West Ham’s five. Five minutes later they took the lead. It was made by Julián Álvarez, who took the ball from Silva then hooked a pass over the head of two defenders. Silva, running on with mischievous intent, got a toe to it as Areola came rushing out, the ball bouncing down and inside the far post. It was escorted there by Haaland, who chose not to apply the final touch and “steal” the goal, what English football historians call an Anti-Nugent. Before the end Haaland had his moment, left in too much space and free to hammer a low shot into the corner. It was his ninth effort at goal on an afternoon that ended with the familiar sight of City’s players applauding the away end, and even Guardiola himself, just a little bit stiff after his back op, going across for his own welcome-back wave."
United,1,Brighton,3,Brighton pile misery on Manchester United as Welbeck sparks away win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/16/manchester-united-brighton-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-16,"“Can we play you every week,” sang the delirious Brighton fans, whose team moved Manchester United to near crisis territory with this breeze of a victory. Roberto De Zerbi’s XI cost a cool £17m (he made six changes from the 3-1 win against Newcastle), Erik ten Hag’s an eye-watering £347m. Yet this was United’s third defeat from five outings – greeted with jeers by the home support – and a second on the bounce. They have six points from a possible 15 and if they lose at Burnley next Saturday, United are engulfed in a plight not in the early season script. Brighton, rightly, ended the game cock-a-hoop. Danny Welbeck, Pascal Gross and João Pedro scored for the visitors who were threatened only sporadically apart from the opening 15 minutes. At 2-0 down on the hour, Ten Hag acted, introducing Hannibal Mejbri and Anthony Martial for Casemiro and Rasmus Højlund. The latter move was greeted with boos for the manager – a sign of the times – whose desperation was marked by Mejbri having not featured for two seasons. On 71 minutes it got worse: one of De Zerbi’s changes was João Pedro and, as with Brighton’s previous goals, the forward was left unmarked and able to blaze past André Onana, who should have saved. This prompted some fans to depart but Mejbri, perhaps disgusted at his colleagues’ capitulation, strode forward and powered a piledriver past Jason Steele. Yet this was United’s brightest moment on an afternoon that started bathed in optimism. The hope had been that two torrid weeks would be ended by the sight of Højlund lining up for his home and full debut. Like all fans, United’s support enjoy a particular frisson at the sight of a new centre-forward. Especially one who is 20 years old, fast, strong, tall and is the symbol of a supposed new era in which on-field fortunes will make recent off-field affairs fade. Not this afternoon, though Højlund displayed a buccaneering zest shown by one raid that saw him marginally miss bulging the back of Steele’s net from Marcus Rashford’s cross. Cue the Dane pounding a palm into the turf and Brighton were warned. Rashford, operating as the second striker in a novel 4-3-1-2 formation, took inspiration. At this stage, he was a fleet-footed threat that bedevilled a Brighton back four led by the towering Lewis Dunk, who had to cope with Højlund stampeding at him each time he tried to build an attack. A win was required to ease the swirl around the club so Welbeck’s opener was a first blow. The former home favourite steered the ball out right to Simon Adingra and moved into an area where the return pass went past the hapless Victor Lindelöf, who was distracted by Adam Lallana. Welbeck rolled the ball into the net, then celebrated before the Stretford End. Lindelöf shook his head and United had to collectively do the same to break the grip their visitors placed on them. Brighton flowed across the pitch, moving the ball through their opponents as if executing a training exercise. United held on and thrust back. A Casemiro diagonal pass reached Rashford who sprinted at the back-pedalling rearguard and let fly: the ball ricocheted off Kaoru Mitoma and on to the frame of Steele’s goal. Close to the break and the VAR was the visitors’ friend. Højlund’s neat swivel-and-strike was correctly chalked off due to Rashford’s cross arriving after the ball went out on the right byline. Close, sure, but Ten Hag’s talk at the interval had to address how United had faded after a promising start. Rashford’s darting run, a replica of the one that led to Højlund’s ruled-out effort, again ended with no end product as United settled in for a defining half. It became torturous due to another too-simple Brighton goal. Mitoma wandered along the left and found Tariq Lamptey who recycled the ball to Gross: a shimmy made a mug of Lisandro Martínez and Onana was beaten to his right. United were missing a swathe of players headed by Jadon Sancho (for disciplinary reasons) and Antony (a leave of absence), plus those with injuries, including Raphaël Varane and Luke Shaw. Yet Brighton did what they did while deploying rising star Evan Ferguson as a replacement only. The Sancho affair has been the main issue. Ten Hag created this with his openness regarding the forward’s absence from the previous loss at Arsenal. Now has to come a change in what he oversees on the field – and quickly."
Wolves,1,Liverpool,3,Andy Robertson’s late strike powers Liverpool’s fightback win at Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/16/wolves-liverpool-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-16,"A couple of minutes after the final whistle Jürgen Klopp stuck his tongue out, licked his lips and saluted the Liverpool supporters spread across the lower bank of the Steve Bull Stand. Seconds before, Klopp hugged Harvey Elliott and hoisted the substitute off the ground. Then it was Luis Díaz’s turn. The suspended Virgil van Dijk, hovering pitchside, high-fived his teammates off the field. Ten minutes or so earlier Elliott jumped two sets of advertising hoardings to celebrate with the away fans after creating Liverpool’s third goal, another comeback victory in the bag; nine of Liverpool’s 13 points this season have come from a losing position. They are now unbeaten in 16 league matches, dating back to April. It is fair to say there was a different mood in the away dressing room at half-time. “I thought a couple of times in the first half: WTF,” Klopp said, acknowledging this really was a game of two halves. Andy Robertson, who captained Liverpool in the absence of Van Dijk and the injured Trent Alexander-Arnold, admitted Klopp was not best pleased at the break. Cody Gakpo prodded in a Mohamed Salah pass 10 minutes into the second half and it was Robertson who took matters into his own hands with five minutes of normal time to spare, earning Liverpool the lead after picking up another perfect but simple pass from Salah. “He probably only gets credit when he gets goals now, which is slightly unfair,” Robertson said. The acting captain collected a shanked kick downfield by the Wolves goalkeeper José Sá close to the centre circle, burst forward and then punched a pass into the channel for Salah. Robertson carried on his run and arrived at the tip of the six-yard box to latch on to Salah’s pass and make an uncomfortable afternoon suddenly rather more bearable. Once Wolves crumbled, Liverpool went for the jugular and Elliott’s strike from the edge of the box was deflected in by Hugo Bueno. “It was a result I didn’t expect after 20 minutes and maybe even not at half-time,” Klopp said. The buildup to this entertaining early kick-off predominantly centred on Klopp’s grievances at the tight turnaround for his South American contingent – prompting him to use Díaz and Darwin Núñez as substitutes here – but by the end it was his opposite number, Gary O’Neil, who was clocking up the mileage, pacing the Wolves technical area wondering how Wolves lost their grip on the game. Wolves deservedly led through Hwang Hee-chan after brilliant work by the electric Pedro Neto but Liverpool levelled when Gakpo struck with his final touch before being subbed. Núñez and Díaz applauded from the sidelines seconds before entering. Liverpool were woeful for almost the entire first 47 minutes. Alexis Mac Allister was arguably the most off-colour of the lot, leading Klopp to joke that the Argentina midfielder should have stayed a little longer in the oxygen mask he used to cope with the high altitude on international duty in Bolivia in midweek. Mac Allister was booked for a sly tug at the shirt of Matheus Cunha inside four minutes was replaced by Díaz, who himself flew back from Chile playing for Colombia, at the interval. The 20-year-old Jarell Quansah, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Bristol Rovers in League One, deputised for Van Dijk and was the best of a bad bunch on his first start for the club he joined aged five. “In such a disorganised team like we were in the first half, being the one who looks kind of all right is a statement,” Klopp said with a smile. At least this time Klopp could see the funny side. The introduction of Díaz and then Núñez – and shifting towards a 4-2-4 when attacking – allowed Liverpool to ask questions of Wolves who, aside from a desperate save from Dominik Szoboszlai on the verge of half-time, had been untroubled. Wolves’s all-action midfield trio of the debutant Jean-Ricner Bellegarde, Mario Lemina and the ubiquitous João Gomes was broken up with 13 minutes to play as fatigue set in. Wolves’s energy dropped but it turned out Liverpool were only just getting started. “You know you’re not going to be the best side against Liverpool for the whole game,” said O’Neil. “If we were getting that much joy against Liverpool for 90 minutes, we’d probably be competing for the title.”"
Arsenal,3,United,1,Declan Rice late strike earns Arsenal dramatic Manchester United victory,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/03/arsenal-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-03,"Despair to joy in the closing stages, this was some turnaround, some way for Arsenal to ignite their season. And some way for Manchester United’s away-day misery to continue. As the Emirates Stadium bellowed the name of their team, United’s pain knew no bounds. Alejandro Garnacho thought that he had won it for the visitors, thought he had landed the most perfect of sucker punches. On as a substitute, the winger accelerated on to a Bruno Fernandes pass in the 89th minute to finish past Aaron Ramsdale and into the Arsenal net. Garnacho had struck late on at Fulham last season to secure Erik ten Hag’s only win in London. It continues to stand as such because of a wild sequence of events that had the Emirates Stadium rocking. First, the VAR spotted that Garnacho had been fractionally offside when he began his run. On the replay it looked as if Gabriel Magalhães, the last Arsenal defender, had sucked in his stomach as he stepped up in the middle. Then Arsenal stole it. Did they deserve to win? It was hard to say after a topsy-turvy game in which they were not convincing, their combinations lacking zip and precision. Not that United were any better. But the bulk of those present did not stop to ask the question. They simply let the emotions run over them after Declan Rice, unmarked beyond the far post on a corner in the sixth minute of stoppage-time, took a touch and his shot flicked off the United substitute Jonny Evans to beat André Onana. It was some way for Rice to score his first Arsenal goal after his £105m summer arrival from West Ham. Ten Hag wanted a foul against Evans by Gabriel. It was not there. In the 81st minute Arsenal thought they had made the decisive move only for Onana to save with his feet from Bukayo Saka. When they showed the replay on the big screen, there was a collective gasp from the home crowd. Saka was at close range when a low cross broke for him and he had to score. But now Arsenal were ahead and the stadium descended into ear-splitting pandemonium when another substitute, Gabriel Jesus, streaked clear at the very end to cut inside Diogo Dalot and roll past Onana. United have still to record a Premier League win at a major rival under Ten Hag and Arsenal have now beaten them three times in a row here. They last achieved that feat in the league in 1991. They have won five and drawn one of the previous six meetings with United at this venue. There were plenty of difficult-to-answer questions, the first concerning how United were able to take the lead on 27 minutes. Until then they had struggled to get beyond the midfield, living on the end of their nerves when building from the back, wayward when going long. Arsenal settled the quicker, determined to play on the front foot and they had the first big chance. Kai Havertz won possession and got his team moving only to miskick badly when the goal beckoned, United having made a mess of clearing a Gabriel Martinelli cross. Inevitably, it was Marcus Rashford who did the damage for United. Christian Eriksen had sparked the break, stepping up to intercept a loose Havertz pass and it was up and over to Rashford. He sliced inside from the left and, with Ben White and William Saliba not close enough, he steered an expert finish inside the far corner. It took Arsenal all of 35 seconds to equalise – a bitter frustration for Ten Hag, United’s undeserved ascendency frittered away. The green and white stripes (yes, United) watched Arsenal ping a few passes, Martinelli playing the key one, a lovely cut back for Martin Ødegaard and he swept home. Every United fan knew their team could conceivably have arrived at the Emirates Stadium with zero points instead of six, results having greatly outstripped performances. They badly needed something more cohesive, an answer to the questions that seem to be everywhere – and that is before we get to the ongoing Glazer drain, the sapping torment of the owners’ tenure. They were better in the second half but it was not enough. Injuries have bitten. Raphaël Varane, Luke Shaw, Tyrell Malacia and Mason Mount are out and there was yet another problem for Ten Hag when Lisandro Martínez was forced off after hurting himself when making a yellow-card tackle on Eddie Nketiah in the 66th minute. Scott McTominay did not travel because of illness. On came Harry Maguire to predictable derision from the Arsenal fans and to partner Victor Lindelöf. Ten Hag would finish with Maguire alongside Evans, the free agent signing – surely not the central defensive pairing he would have envisaged in a Champions League season. Lindelöf had spent a booking on a cynical foul on Ntekiah just before half-time and, after Ramsdale had denied the disappointing Anthony Martial, White blocking the rebound from Rashford, Arsenal thought they had a penalty. Havertz got away from Aaron Wan-Bissaka and in front of Casemiro before he went down. But the VAR saw that he had anticipated the contact rather than actually felt it and overturned the award. Once again, it was not Havertz’s day. Ten Hag introduced the £72m signing Rasmus Højlund and he had a couple of promising moments on his debut, Ten Hag feeling he might have had a penalty from a tussle with Gabriel. Martinelli guided a shot narrowly wide and Rashford would menace at the other end. Cue the late drama."
Liverpool,3,Villa,0,Szoboszlai and Salah fire Liverpool to dominant win against Aston Villa,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/03/liverpool-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-03,"The Saudi riches being thrown the way of Mohamed Salah should not prevent Jürgen Klopp enjoying the international break with supreme optimism over the present and future of Liverpool. His remodelled team excelled again in a dominant defeat of Aston Villa with Salah, almost inevitably, to the fore. Unai Emery’s visitors arrived at Anfield in confident form but were comfortably eclipsed by a tireless Liverpool performance in which Klopp’s players shone on and off the ball. Dominik Szoboszlai opened the scoring inside three minutes and Villa never threatened to respond. An own goal from Matty Cash plus a tap-in from Salah maintained Liverpool’s stylish and unbeaten start to the new campaign in the 300th league game of Klopp’s reign. The Egypt international, subject of a rejected £150m bid from Al-Ittihad and continued interest from the Saudi Pro League, was involved in all three goals. It could easily have been five. There was no sign of Salah being distracted by speculation around his future as he got on with the job of winning. “It was a top game, the best for a long time,” the Liverpool manager said. “I can’t remember the last time we were that convincing. The mix in possession between control and direction was close to perfect. We used the formation properly, everybody wanted the ball and to protect. It was a top game against an extremely strong opponent.” Darwin Núñez was rewarded for his matchwinning heroics at Newcastle last Sunday with a first start of the season. The Uruguay international and Liverpool began where they left off at St James’ Park; on the front foot, pressing relentlessly and constantly unsettling the opposition defence, and with the added bonus of doing so with 11 players. Villa looked slow and confused by comparison. “We were a little bit weak defensively, we could have been stronger,” Emery said. The hosts were ahead when the new favourite of Liverpool’s midfield, Szoboszlai, swept home his first goal for the club and the 900th scored under Klopp in all competitions. It arrived from a Trent Alexander-Arnold corner, conceded by Pau Torres after the dawdling Villa defender had been dispossessed inside his own area by Salah. The set piece sailed through a crowded goalmouth towards Szoboszlai, lurking unmarked outside the box, who connected with a beautiful first time drive that flew inside the stranded Emiliano Martínez’s left‑hand post. Villa were under siege, finding no outlets, and suffered another early setback when Diego Carlos hobbled off injured. The unfortunate defender missed most of last season with a ruptured achilles tendon and required lengthy treatment before exiting down the tunnel. Emery responded positively, introducing another attacking option in Leon Bailey and returning Cash to right-back. The same could not be said of his team. Within two minutes of the substitution Villa were two goals down. The manner in which the visitors conceded was unfortunate but their high line was exposed yet again when Alexander-Arnold released Salah with a floated ball. The coveted Egyptian touched the pass inside to Núñez who cannoned a shot against the post. Cash could do nothing about a rebound that smacked against his shins and sailed into his own net. There was a brief, belated spell of pressure from the visitors when John McGinn blazed over and Bailey made a mess of finishing off a flowing move involving Douglas Luiz and Lucas Digne. But Liverpool remained dominant and would have been out of sight by the interval had Joël Matip not sent a free header wide from an Alexander-Arnold free-kick or Núñez’s deft chip over Martínez not hit the bar. This time Cash cleared the rebound the right way, heading off the line before Luis Díaz could convert. Considering Liverpool were without their first-choice centre-backs Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté, through suspension and injury respectively, this sunny Sunday stroll could not have gone much better for Klopp’s side. A hamstring injury to Alexander-Arnold was the only defensive blot on their afternoon. Joe Gomez and Matip comfortably subdued Ollie Watkins while Alisson denied Cash with a fine save when Villa did create a chance for a consolation. Substitute Bailey headed straight down the tunnel when he was replaced by Nicolò Zaniolo. By then it was three. At the end of a week when Liverpool rejected £150m for his services, with a higher offer potentially to come, Salah had the decisive touch. Núñez flicked an Andy Robertson corner to the back post where Salah sprinted in ahead of Digne to convert. It was the 150th different game in which Salah has scored for Liverpool. Klopp is adamant there will be a 151st."
Palace,3,Wolves,2,Odsonne Édouard and Eberechi Eze shine as Crystal Palace hold off Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/03/crystal-palace-wolves-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-03,"Attempting to maintain a status quo is a dangerous game to play in the Premier League. Yet more dangerous is attempting to maintain it after selling off the family silver. In the 11 months since Wolves last played at Selhurst, Julen Lopetegui has come and gone, while star midfielders in Rúben Neves and Matheus Nunes have been cashed out, among many others, to offset financial concerns. Sasa Kalajdzic, Wolves’ saviour last week at Everton, was not ready to start after the cruciate injury that meant he played no part last season. When he was introduced with nine minutes left, Wolves were behind to the inspiration of the outstanding Eberechi Eze. They could find no way back and Odsonne Édouard, with his second goal, soon put Palace beyond reach. Matheus Cunha’s header in the dying seconds of added time broke the sequence of all Wolves’ Premier League goals this season having been scored by substitutes. Gary O’Neil had repeated the trick on Sunday, with Hwang Hee-chan equalising Édouard’s opener in a quick exchange of second-half goals. It became the turn of Wolves’ defence to be sub-optimal. O’Neil has been handed a sow’s ear compared to recent Wolves predecessors. Fábio Silva, signed three years ago and still to live up to the reputation with which he arrived, wore No 9 and spent 74 minutes chasing shadows. At Bournemouth last season, O’Neil proved himself in crisis management but his new team’s lack of attacking quality or variety appear to make this assignment an even taller order. “We lacked a little bit of punch,” said O’Neil, who felt until Palace’s goals his team had been unlikely to lose. “We didn’t threaten their goal for a variety of reasons.” Wolves are not alone in losing talent. Palace’s decisive goalscorer in last season’s fixture, Wilfried Zaha, has departed for Galatasaray and Michael Olise, though still at the club, was missing through injury. It left creativity in the highly capable hands of Eze, assisted by the contributions of the reliable, underrated, and always energetic Jeffrey Schlupp. For Eze’s first genuine burst after a drab opening 10 minutes, he had João Gomes in a tangle that had VAR checking for a possible penalty, eventually not given. That unnerved Wolves’s defence, who then almost coughed up the opener. Goalkeeper José Sá’s pass mistakenly put Jordan Ayew in, only for Max Kilman to make a goalline clearance. Each Eze burst brought the Holmesdale End ultras to their feet. The Wolves fans in Selhurst’s away corner, shielding their eyes in the sun, could only yearn for such an entertainer, though Pedro Neto, a remainder of the club’s still sizeable Portuguese contingent, had his moments in assisting both goals. “I’ve always liked him,” said O’Neil, saying he has seen improvements in his squad since his arrival on the eve of the season. Silva’s sole meaningful effort on goal came on the half-hour, a difficult chance ballooned behind, for which he received a fist-bump of encouragement from Pablo Sarabia, the Spaniard similarly starved. Still, the first half closed with the visitors enjoying the greater possession and Neto forcing a save from Sam Johnstone. “The first half was nowhere near what we are capable of,” said Roy Hodgson, happy with the result if not his team. “I wasn’t pleased with the performance and neither were the players. I made certain people buck up their ideas. I told them if they continued playing like this, we would lose the game.” After 10 minutes of second-half torpor, Eze robbed Gomes and was pulled back for a yellow-card offence. No matter. Within seconds, Édouard had scored, telescoping his leg ahead of Kilman to stab in after Cheick Doucouré’s interception and Tyrick Mitchell’s overlap. O’Neil threw on Hwang as soon as Édouard’s celebrations died down and within moments, the Korean had diverted Neto’s cross in via a shoulder. The shock of an equaliser served to lift Palace rather than Wolves. Sá made a fine save from Ayew’s bludgeoned volley as Eze began to step up his involvement. He first slapped in a vicious free-kick that had Sá sprawling to save and then, from Joel Ward’s ball to Jean-Philippe Mateta, controlled and stabbed home with the panache of a player called up to the England squad and flush with confidence that this is his time to shine."
Brighton,3,Newcastle,1,Brighton brilliant as Evan Ferguson’s hat-trick stuns shaky Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/02/brighton-newcastle-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-02,"Everything in the end came down to the moment 20 minutes into the second half when Evan Ferguson received Billy Gilmour’s pass 30 yards from goal, turned and, with a sense of unflustered inevitability, caressed his shot into the bottom corner. It was a goal of stunning quality, his brilliant finish the centrepiece of the first of what will surely be many Premier League hat-tricks. But there was another element to the goal, which was how much space he was in. There was an element of fortune in the buildup, Newcastle drawn forward as it appeared Gilmour had miscontrolled. But that space at the back of their midfield was an issue throughout. Although Newcastle were effective in disrupting Brighton’s preferred route out from defence, from centre-back to Gilmour, once the home side were able to advance, João Pedro often had space. Bruno Guimarães, fine ball-player that he is, is not a natural destroyer and, while Joelinton and Joe Willock or Sean Longstaff were able to fulfil that function last season, the introduction of Sandro Tonali, for all his attacking qualities, may have disrupted the balance. The withdrawal of Tonali and Joelinton for Longstaff and Elliot Anderson just before the hour seemed an admission of that from Eddie Howe. “The midfield is in its infancy,” the manager said. “That’s not necessarily a criticism of any one of them. It takes time to build the relationships.” Willock has suffered a setback in his attempts to return from an achilles injury and will not, as had been hoped, resume training next week. Howe’s side have now lost three in a row and, in all three, there has perhaps been a lack of conviction. In themselves, defeats to Manchester City, Liverpool and Brighton shouldn’t be too much of a concern, but as a cluster, particularly given the nature of the defeat to Liverpool, there is perhaps a slight sense of unease. Certainly the home game against Brentford with which Newcastle resume after the international break takes on an unexpected significance. Howe seemed determined to downplay any nascent sense of crisis, acknowledging the “ruthless” nature of the Premier League but stressing he would “analyse the game and see what we can do better” – just as he does after every match. He also pointed to “a tough fixture list” as a reason behind the run of poor form. And that is probably fair enough; Newcastle missed early chances and then, as Howe said, contributed to their own downfall. The first goal stemmed from a poor clearance from Nick Pope, then an ineffectual wag of the foot from Tonali before Pope spilled an admittedly well-hit shot from Gilmour. Ferguson’s third was the result of a big deflection and Callum Wilson’s strike, though well-taken, was too late to make a difference. Nobody really doubts that Howe did a fine job last season and there should be no real pressure yet, but equally nobody has yet seen how Newcastle’s Saudi owners respond to disappointment. At the end of a week in which Newcastle’s new status was reinforced by a Champions League draw that set up games against Paris Saint-Germain, Borussia Dortmund and Milan, this was a reminder that, beyond the glamour, there is still the basic necessity to win football matches. For Brighton, similarly, it had been a week of barely conceivable events: drawing Ajax, Marseille and AEK Athens in the Europa League, Pascal Gross winning a Germany call-up and the signings of Ansu Fati and Carlos Baleba. Ferguson, though, might be the most exciting element of all. “I was delighted today – not just for the goals but I’m really pleased for the performance,” said Roberto De Zerbi. “Especially in the first half he played very well, found the right position between the lines. He understood very well the position. He is working to complete his quality, he can become big, big, big. He can become the top scorer in Europe.” Only three other 18-year-olds – Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler and Chris Bart-Williams – have scored Premier League hat-tricks. While De Zerbi acknowledged it was probably just as well the transfer window had closed last night, he also made the point that the “most important thing for Brighton is not to keep hold of their most important player; it’s to find the replacement”. That is the philosophy that has taken them to their current heights. And while Ferguson’s excellence means they can in effect write off last week’s defeat to West Ham as a blip, Newcastle have no such resort. These are heady times for both clubs, but Newcastle must just be starting to wonder whether this glitch might become a wobble."
Brentford,2,Bournemouth,2,Bryan Mbeumo makes Brentford point in pulsating Bournemouth draw,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/02/brentford-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-02,"Belief and resilience are traits Brentford have always displayed when faced with adversity and it was no surprise to see them here as Bryan Mbeumo’s equaliser in the third minute of added time gave them a point, preserving their unbeaten Premier League record. It appeared Bournemouth would steal victory despite a dominant second-half performance from the hosts and the equaliser was a huge blow for Andoni Iraola’s side. “We finished the game pretty tired,” said the Bournemouth manager. “It could be a fair result. Even if we were closer, but they deserved, especially with the chances they had.” “What a game,” said the Brentford manager, Thomas Frank. “We are playing very entertaining football and we have scored eight goals in four games. The mentality in this team is incredible and we still went for it [after the equaliser]. Very proud of the team’s performance.” Kevin Schade retained his place in the Brentford XI having scored his first league goal for the club in last Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace and he showed why Frank decided to make his move from Freiburg permanent. He looked menacing down the left, winning aerial duels and linking up well with Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa. After Neto, the Bournemouth keeper, got a hand to a cross he did not anticipate Schade chasing down the loose ball where he would foul the Brentford forward just outside the penalty area, somehow avoiding a booking. From the resulting free-kick, Mathias Jensen spotted a gap at the near post and decided to fire his effort goalwards where the ball was adjudged to have crossed the line. After screams from the home support along with a delayed buzz from the watch of the referee, Robert Madley, the goal was given. Brentford still looked vulnerable whenever Bournemouth threatened, with Justin Kluivert striking fear down the left. A neat passage of play involving the Dutch forward included Ryan Christie dribbling past two defenders but the midfielder ran into his teammate Dominic Solanke, with Mark Flekken, the Brentford goalkeeper, gratefully receiving the loose ball. Bournemouth were almost caught out by a sublime move. A deft pass from the captain, Christian Nørgaard, set the impressive Schade away but his effort smacked a post, which was perhaps the first-half’s telling moment. A second goal could have deflated the visitors but they kept pushing and were rewarded through Solanke’s equaliser. A well-weighted pass from Marcos Senesi set the striker away and having got the better of Ethan Pinnock, he finished with aplomb past Flekken to deservedly put Bournemouth back on level terms. The setback would have angered Frank given Jensen’s early goal but they were outplayed for the majority of the first half by a side who are winless. Frank would have demanded a reaction after his side’s inability to hold on to a lead at home for the third time in succession and he almost got his wish on several occasions. Rico Henry found Mbeumo unattended in the penalty area but the forward diverted his effort off-target with Neto beaten. The left-back played in Wissa but his effort hit a post It appeared Brentford would be the next to score, but a poor back‑pass from Henry made its way into the path of James Tavernier, whose rampaging run found the substitute David Brooks, who dummied Flekken and tapped into an empty net. It appeared Bournemouth would hang on for a first away win against these opponents since 2005 but Mbeumo’s late intervention ensured Brentford claimed a share of the points, though Frank may feel they should have taken all three."
City,5,Fulham,1,Erling Haaland hits Manchester City hat-trick but Fulham rue VAR decision,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/02/manchester-city-fulham-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-02,"VAR continues to do the very opposite of the technology’s supposed function: it creates controversy rather than eradicating it. Manchester City enter the international break with a maximum 12 points, though this fourth win of the season was hardly the champions at their smoothest, despite Erling Haaland scoring his fifth Premier League hat-trick, and it turned on a second goal that restored their lead and left Fulham furious. From Phil Foden’s corner, a Nathan Aké header flew in, going past Manuel Akanji who leaped over it from an offside position and appeared to be “in the line of vision” (making this an infringement, the law states) of Fulham’s goalkeeper, Bernd Leno. But Tony Harrington, the VAR, ruled Akanji was not impeding Leno and he had also judged the Swiss not to have touched the ball (another potential illegality). Cue an understandably livid Fulham manager, Marco Silva. Further disquiet followed: after the home side had thrown a ball on believing it was needed for the restart, Kyle Walker hurled one back in the direction of Luís Boa Morte, one of the visiting coaches, and words were exchanged. All of this occurred after Fulham had fought back admirably, having overcome City’s initial lead through Julián Álvarez and the aftershocks of the farrago of João Palhinha’s deadline day transfer to Bayern Munich (he took a medical and posed for pictures in the strip) that collapsed when time ran out. City were not their dominant selves. Tom Cairney’s withdrawal due to a 16th-minute injury, to compund Palhinha’s absence, meant Fulham were two creative midfield forces down but they tapped passes about and took the match to their hosts. City’s opener was as much a hotchpotch as their display. Mateo Kovacic’s pass to Haaland impressed, but the striker’s shot was a mis-hit that became a lucky cross for Álvarez to roll home at close range. The champions are usually ruthless when taking the lead. Not here. Two minutes later, they had conceded. Andreas Pereira swung in a corner from the right and Raúl Jiménez helped the ball on. Bobby De Cordova-Reid shot, Ederson saved but Tim Ream followed up to equalise. In Kalvin Phillips, Bernardo Silva, Sergio Gómez, Josko Gvardiol and Matheus Nunes (the last two signed this summer), the treble winners had £226m of talent spread across five substitutes. Yet their on-field colleagues grasped for control and rhythm on a day when another fresh acquisition, Jérémy Doku, made his debut. In Jack Grealish, not in the squad due to a minor thigh problem that casts doubt over his England involvement next week, there was a further £100m footballer missing, but the biggest absences were the long-term injured Kevin De Bruyne and the manager, Pep Guardiola, who had to watch his misfiring team from home while convalescing after a back operation. All great sides find a way when struggling. As the interval neared, City took the lead courtesy of Aké’s header and while they remained discordant after the goal they were still capable of flashes of brilliance, as was the case for Haaland’s third. Akanji found Rodri, who relayed the ball to Álvarez. His instant pass deflected off Ream into the Norwegian’s path, whose cool finish brought him his fourth goal this season. Game over? Fulham thought not as soon Jiménez teed up Luke Harris, on for Cairney, but his insipid effort was easy for Ederson to clutch. Haaland scored his second via a penalty after Issa Diop felled Álvarez in the area and his hat-trick arrived in added time, Gómez’s trickery along the left creating the opening for the prolific marksman. After collecting yet another match ball, Haaland reflected on City’s slow start to the match. “Every year is like this at this club. We start a bit late and a bit sloppy because we play right until the last game [of every season] because we are the best club. It is how it is. We will only get better and better from here.” Of Haaland, Juanma Lillo, City’s assistant manager, said: “In the first half none of the team played well, we didn’t find the freshness and our opponents kept the ball well, it would have been difficult for any No. 9. I said in the break to him: ‘This is not an easy game, but you can still help us by scoring.’ And he scored three. This guy was born to score goals ” City winning when misfiring and Haaland still scoring: ominous for their rivals."
Burnley,2,Spurs,5,Spurs roar back to crush Burnley thanks to Son’s hat-trick and Maddison magic,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/02/burnley-tottenham-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-02,"The arms were outstretched and the adulation flowing from an away end packed with Tottenham supporters celebrating James Maddison’s role in dismantling Burnley, although he was about to be upstaged by Son Heung-min’s hat-trick. For a number of years, Tottenham have been reliant on the man with No 10 on his back to pull them through but Maddison is a different beast to his predecessor. He has the sort of swagger and skill to entertain his own fans, while infuriating opponents with a theatrical demeanour. All of this was on show as Spurs continued their unbeaten league start under Ange Postecoglou. It was the third goal that proved his influence on proceedings and summed up Burnley’s failings. The hosts gave the ball away in their own defensive area, before Maddison collected it in space 20 yards from goal and fired into the back of the net. This marked the end of the contest. Son, playing centrally, completed a triple to remove any optimism the home fans may have maintained, and to prove he can be the clinical finisher Tottenham require. Maddison provides the swagger, while Son the ruthlessness – it is a fine combination for Spurs fans. “Today was a real testament to Sonny, Madders and [Cristian] Romero, the way they embraced that responsibility not just with words but with actions, and not just on game day but on a daily basis,” Postecoglou said. “That’s as encouraging for me as anything because as good as they are individually they have team spirit and that’s important for me. “Madders is so creative and he showed how clinical he is in front of goal and his preparedness to work hard for the team is a great example.” Things looked as if they could have been different in the early stages when Burnley were showing the sort of football Vincent Kompany has been searching for since he arrived. It helped create an open, free-flowing game but ultimately to the host’s detriment. Luca Koleosho was making the ninth first-team appearance of his career and the 18-year-old showed why his manager is such an admirer by creating the opening goal. A sweeping break from back to front resulted in the winger getting behind Pedro Porro and showing neat footwork before crossing for Lyle Foster to divert home in the fourth minute. But things rapidly declined for the hosts. Their flailing defence was caught out by a quarterback-style pinpoint long pass from Porro to Son, who – after an exchange with Manor Solomon – was afforded the space to dink a shot over James Trafford. The problem arose because Burnley had too many players forward and were caught out two-on-two at the back but they are happy to live and die by the sword. The visitors took control of the match around the half-hour mark, relying on Maddison’s creativity to make the difference. He was impressive and at the heart of everything Spurs did going forward, a timely reminder for Gareth Southgate. Lapses in concentration repeatedly cost Burnley. In first-half injury time they failed to clear a corner, allowing Maddison time on the ball to get to the byline. His cross, via a few deflections, landed at an unmarked Romero’s feet on the edge of the box. From there Romero picked out the top corner. Burnley switched to a back five but it did little to change proceedings. There were three chances in the first four minutes after half-time as the redesigned defence was pulled apart, first by Maddison’s precise goal and later by Son’s composure inside the box, adding a fourth and fifth. Some home fans stayed to boo Maddison off late on but fewer saw Josh Brownhill’s consolation. “I’ve only got to know him recently but he’s a very strong, resilient guy,” Postecoglou said of Maddison. “He’s mentally strong and he likes, not to be targeted, but he wants the ball and he wants to be in those situations and has that quality.” Postecoglou and Kompany are in the infancy of their Premier League managerial careers but the Australian seems to have the perfect blueprint, while his Belgian counterpart will be looking at turning things around after securing no points and conceding 11 goals in three matches. “I don’t think anyone is naive going into this division, we know it is a challenge,” Kompany said. “If you look at the total amount of points the three promoted teams have got this season, you realise that every game is going to be tough. At times, especially in the second half, we weren’t able to compete.”"
Chelsea,0,Forest,1,Anthony Elanga strikes to earn shock win for Nottingham Forest at Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/02/chelsea-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-02,"If only there was an accountancy trick that could mask Chelsea’s awful numbers in front of goal. Unfortunately for Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital there is no way to amortise a home defeat to a ruthless Nottingham Forest. As Mauricio Pochettino heard the home fans greet the final whistle with fierce boos, it was strange to think that £1bn has gone into building a side so lacking in nous, leadership and ways to respond against opponents intent on frustrating them at Stamford Bridge. The problems confronting Pochettino are nothing new given that Chelsea have earned 11 home wins in all competitions since the start of last season. This is a team bereft of edge in the final third, a team of young players who look unsure of themselves in tricky situations, and nobody who has been paying close attention to recent events here could say they were particularly surprised when Forest pounced on one defensive slip and stole the points thanks to Anthony Elanga’s clinical finish at the start of the second half. Forest had executed Steve Cooper’s astute plan to perfection, defending with discipline before striking on the break, Elanga’s first goal for the club a timely boost after Brennan Johnson’s move to Tottenham. Chelsea, who had made great play about their summer signings having an average age of 20.5 years, looked callow by comparison. “This type of game will help us to be more mature,” Pochettino said. “It’s not only about having quality.” He would go on to talk about playing with more aggression and he must have been worried by the way desperation took hold once Chelsea went behind. There was a glaring miss from Nicolas Jackson, a wild swipe from Raheem Sterling and nothing from an array of expensive substitutes. Pochettino tried everything – throwing Cole Palmer on for his debut a day after the winger’s £42.5m move from Manchester City, turning to the £88.5m Mykhailo Mudryk more in hope than expectation – but there was no way Forest were going to surrender a first away win since January. “We talked about how we could hurt Chelsea and then after that it was about keeping a clean sheet,” Cooper said. “There is no shame in that.” There was much to admire about Forest’s defending. Ola Aina neutralised Sterling, who did little to show that Gareth Southgate was wrong to leave him out of the England squad, and Chelsea toiled throughout a tepid first half. There was possession but no incision, the threat limited to a couple of hopeful efforts from Enzo Fernández and the hosts did not look comfortable defending set pieces. Taiwo Awoniyi bullied Thiago Silva at times and the Forest striker missed two good chances to opening the scoring. Forest’s plan was working. Much is made of their frenzied activity in the transfer market – seven signings arrived on deadline day – but it has not stopped Cooper from making sure his players know how to do their jobs. Chelsea lacked such cohesion. So much changed during the summer and Forest would take advantage of the uncertainty three minutes into the second half. There was a mix-up in midfield, Moisés Caicedo and Conor Gallagher taking it in turns to squander possession, and Orel Mangala was able to make a crucial interception. The ball ran to Awoniyi, he nutmegged Silva with a clever pass and Elanga, on for the injured Danilo, escaped Levi Colwill before sliding a composed shot past Robert Sánchez. A hush descended over the home sections. Pochettino looked to his bench for inspiration and removed the £115m Caicedo. Palmer came on to play as the No 10, Noni Madueke moved to the right flank and Ian Maatsen entered the fray. But Forest, whose defence was expertly marshalled by Joe Worrall, were giving little away. The worry for Forest, though, was that they had blown a 2-0 lead at Manchester United last Saturday. An equaliser looked certain when Sterling reached the right byline and cut the ball back for Jackson, only for the striker to prod the ball over from three yards. Pochettino would soon hear the boos."
Sheffield,2,Everton,2,Jordan Pickford’s last-ditch heroics save Everton in tense Sheffield United draw,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/02/sheffield-united-everton-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-02,"And then they had one. Belatedly, Sheffield United and Everton – holders of absolutely nothing after their opening three Premier League games – have something to show for their efforts. Over an adrenaline filled lunchtime, both led – Everton first through Abdoulaye Doucouré, and then the home side via an unfortunate Jordan Pickford own goal; both equalised – Cameron Archer first for the hosts, Arnaut Danjuma later for the visitors; both earned their first point of the season. It was as breathless as it sounds. It was gripping to the very last too, Pickford producing a pair of point-blank final-moment saves to deny Oli McBurnie. Pickford needed first bar, then post, to ensure Everton avoided their worst start to a Premier League season. Instead, they have matched their measly 1994-95 haul. Pickford’s smile as he shook the hand of Sheffield United manager, Paul Heckingbottom, was as much relief as anything. “It’s another example of why we love the game and how fine the margins are,” said Heckingbottom. “We’re not stupid – we know we need a lot of those moments to go in our favour this season. Today it didn’t. But I can’t grumble – it was probably a fair result.” “Frustrating but pleased,” said the Everton manager, Sean Dyche, clearly still processing his thoughts. “It would have been an injustice,” was where he landed when pondering what defeat might have felt like. It was a game imbued with an odd tension, a tetchiness too, one often felt in the sunshine of May, but rarely in September. Misplaced passes – of which there were plenty – were met with groans. Bluster aplenty, little glimpses of control but no real assertive dominance. Positives? Yes, in the main from each side’s debutant centre-forwards. For Everton, Beto, a £26m acquisition from Udinese. For Sheffield United, Archer, a £18.5m buy from Aston Villa. Relatively, both clubs find themselves shopping in the basics range, but there is still a level of expectation that money will be spent wisely. Early signs point to customer satisfaction. In Archer and Gustavo Hamer, the Blades have a pair of the second-tier’s delights of last season. Hamer is all spark and a little bite, a pair of early mazy forays down the flanks setting the tone. But most promising was the ease in which he and Archer combined, both men heavily involved in the equaliser. It was the only extended moment of beauty. Hamer worked his own space on the right and whipped in a ball that McBurnie controlled perfectly. The subsequent layoff was equally on the money, Archer’s curled finish sublime. It screamed natural goalscorer. “It was just instinct,” Archer said. The goal that nudged his side ahead was a tad more fortuitous, though. Not from Hamer’s initial over-the-shoulder ball to Archer, nor from the subsequent curled 25-yard effort that hit a post’s base. No, it was when the rebound bounced off Pickford’s back and over the line, that only a wry smile would do. A little more than half an hour had passed since Doucouré had given Everton an early lead. For that, kudos to Beto, who earned the corner that allowed Doucouré to thrust his knee at Amadou Onana’s header. Wes Foderingham’s firm palm only left Doucouré with a simple finish. A total of 317 league minutes after Doucouré’s previous strike, he had another. The problem? None of his teammates had managed to do likewise in the time between. Beto – instrumental as the substitute who spared Everton midweek embarrassment at Doncaster – was superb. The striker has a strange ability to be both languid and powerful, to provide a focal point but also act as playmaker, to combine willpower with skill. “He’s come with a smile on his face and wants to work,” said Dyche. “He’s done well again today.” Everton fans journeying home will gush over a backheeled flick to find Danjuma that was as unexpected as it was dashing, a burst of pace down the right had Jack Robinson treading treacle, and then a round-the-corner pass for Nathan Patterson. From that, Patterson’s low cross was met by Danjuma to make it 2-2. And breathe."
Luton,1,West Ham,2,Bowen and Zouma extend West Ham’s soaring start to ruin Luton’s big return,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/01/luton-west-ham-premier-league-match-report,2023-09-01,"When it was over the beaten players of Luton Town lingered for a few minutes, marched around the pitch and made sure to thank the crowd for their magnificent support. The home fans had done everything to make Kenilworth Road’s first taste of the Premier League an occasion to remember, keeping the volume high from start to finish, and it would have been quite something if Carlton Morris had taken a late chance to equalise moments before Kurt Zouma scored the goal that carried West Ham back to the top of the table. Unfortunately for Luton their big night would end with another lesson about the harsh reality of life at the highest level. West Ham punched through with fleeting moments of quality, Jarrod Bowen putting them ahead after meeting a lovely cross from Lucas Paquetá shortly before half-time, and stayed resilient during a testing second half. Luton, who remain pointless after three games, simply lacked the flair to hurt tough, experienced opponents. Yet while Rob Edwards’s side look a long shot to stay up, even at this early stage, at least nobody can accuse them of a lack of heart. Luton kept fighting after going 2-0 down, Mads Andersen setting up a frantic finish by pulling a goal back in stoppage time, and might have had a reward for their defiance had John Brooks, the VAR, decided to take a closer look at James Ward-Prowse appearing to handle in West Ham’s area during the closing moments. “I’ve only seen a freeze frame,” Edwards said. “If it was a penalty I’m disappointed it’s gone against us. Those are the moments you need at this level. But I’m not going to complain about that. We need to look at ourselves and see where we can get better. I’ve seen some good things and progression. Ultimately that’s got to lead to points.” Not since April 1992 had this inimitable ground hosted a game in the top flight. Luton have been through so much since then, from the agony of dropping out of the Football League in 2010, to the ecstasy of last season’s improbable promotion, and in that context it hardly mattered that a few renovations were required before they could finally play at home this season. West Ham had to earn the right to play. Luton pressed, Marvelous Nakamba and Tahith Chong working hard in midfield, and kept aiming long balls towards Morris. Alphonse Areola, West Ham’s goalkeeper, had to be alert. The Frenchman gave his team one early scare, flapping nervously at a cross from the left, and was relieved to see Ross Barkley drag a shot wide. As the opening period progressed, though, doubts grew over Luton’s quality in the final third. Morris and Elijah Adebayo were a blunt pairing up front and West Ham settled thanks to the composure of their new midfield pairing of Edson Álvarez and Ward-Prowse. Firm in the tackle and calm in possession, Álvarez went close to opening the scoring from the edge of the area. Gaps were opening. Bowen and Saïd Benrahma shot wide and the breakthrough soon arrived, Luton paying a heavy price when they gave Paquetá time to cross in the 37th minute. They will know better than to let a £51m Brazil international lift his head next time. There was no pressure on Paquetá and he took advantage by picking out Bowen, who peeled away from Amari’i Bell before heading past Thomas Kaminski, who fumbled the ball into the net. “Jarrod took his goal well,” David Moyes said. “He’s always a threat. We’ve brought in a lot of positivity from winning the European trophy last year.” Luton needed more belief if they were to deny West Ham a second consecutive away win. Their response was positive, Morris glancing a header wide, Chong going close, but the attacks remained predictable. Zouma kept heading crosses away and West Ham threatened at the start of the second half, Emerson Palmieri’s goal disallowed for offside, Benrahma denied after meeting Ward-Prowse’s low cross. Luton took heart from those near misses. Alfie Doughty had a shot deflected over after cutting in from the right and Ryan Giles nutmegged Paquetá. Then a mix-up between Nayef Aguerd and Areola almost gifted Adebayo an equaliser. West Ham could feel their control slipping away. It was not a surprise when Moyes introduced the discipline of Pablo Fornals in place of Benrahma. West Ham needed to stiffen up and were soon using their know-how to slow the game down, with Álvarez repeatedly dropping into defence to help Aguerd and Zouma. The openings dried up for Luton. They needed sharpness when one finally appeared but Morris lashed over when the ball dropped to him in the box. It was a pivotal moment. West Ham scored with their next attack, Ward-Prowse swinging in a corner and Zouma’s header momentarily silencing the locals. Andersen’s goal counted for nothing."
Newcastle,1,Liverpool,2,Darwin Núñez’s late double steals win for 10-man Liverpool to stun Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/27/newcastle-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-27,"Shortly before the last World Cup Gareth Southgate had the humility to admit that his in-game management still contained room for improvement. The England coach’s sole problem is that his side simply do not play sufficient matches to allow him to make enough of the inspired mid‑match substitutions and tactical switches which set managers such as Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp apart from the crowd. No matter; at least Southgate was on Tyneside to study a Klopp masterclass in overcoming adversity and winning against all odds at first hand. With Liverpool reduced to 10 men after Virgil van Dijk’s 28th-minute sending-off and having fallen behind to Anthony Gordon’s fine opener three minutes earlier, Klopp used his substitutes brilliantly. He was duly rewarded by two exceptional late goals from the perhaps unlikely figure of Darwin Núñez. If the Uruguay striker’s winner in stoppage time demonstrated why he was worth the record £85m Liverpool paid Benfica for his services last summer after all, his manager’s earlier introduction of, among others, Diogo Jota, helped not only to bring the best out in Mo Salah but put Eddie Howe firmly in his place. The home manager had hoped to confirm a changing of the guard in football’s northern powerhouse by choreographing Newcastle’s first Premier League win against Liverpool since 2015 and things certainly began well for him. If the duel involving Newcastle’s Gordon and Liverpool’s sometimes inverted right back, Trent Alexander‑Arnold, always promised to prove an intriguing subplot few onlookers can have expected it to provoke match‑changing controversy quite so quickly. After only five minutes Alexander-Arnold received a yellow card for flicking the ball away in frustration after being unceremoniously shoved into the technical area by Gordon. It seemed harsh, pedantic even, but under the latest edicts on the laws, the referee, John Brooks had little option but to issue the booking. A minute later a seething Alexander-Arnold blocked Gordon’s path by flinging out an arm, catching the left winger with a stray elbow. It seemed worthy of another yellow card but – resisting considerable pressure from Howe and Newcastle’s captain, Kieran Trippier – Brooks resisted. Perhaps unnerved, Alexander-Arnold swiftly lost concentration at a vital moment. In permitting Salah’s admittedly awkward pass to squirm beneath his studs the full-back allowed Gordon to steal in, seize possession and show off some impressive acceleration before sending a low shot whizzing under Alisson en route to the back of the net. High on adrenaline and exhibiting the sort of change of pace which suggested he might have hired Usain Bolt as a sprint coach, Gordon was simply irrepressible at this point. As a former Evertonian the England Under‑21s winger certainly appeared to be enjoying running Alexander-Arnold and the increasingly ruffled Joël Matip ragged in front of Southgate. When Gordon – who else – slipped a ball through to Alexander Isak, the Sweden forward had a clear sight of goal only to be sent crashing by Van Dijk’s scything challenge just outside the penalty area. Although a VAR review vindicated Brooks’s controversy-tinged decision to issue a straight red card, neither the centre-half nor Klopp took that call too well but things could have deteriorated even further for Liverpool had Alisson not performed acrobatic wonders to somehow keep out Miguel Almirón’s goal‑bound volley. It is not yet September but we have a worthy save-of-the-season contender. Klopp had responded to his side’s reduction to 10 men by sacrificing Luis Díaz in order to introduce Joe Gomez’s defensive qualities and afford a struggling midfield a measure of protection. Although Dominik Szoboszlai – a Hungary international also much admired by Howe – looked very good at times, Alexis Mac Allister and Wataru Endo, making his first Liverpool start, struggled for touches and made minimal impact. It left Newcastle’s Sandro Tonali, ably assisted by Joelinton to pull the midfield strings, creating a framework in which Gordon’s stream of menacing crosses repeatedly unhinged Klopp’s backline. Whether or not Salah wants to leave Liverpool for a new life in Saudi Arabia remains a matter of conjecture but, whatever his innermost feelings, the Egypt striker offered Liverpool fans a glimmer of hope courtesy of the odd menacing attacking cameo. That Salah rarely broke through was less about him and more about the excellence with which Sven Botman generally dealt with his cleverly insidious movement. Indeed a visiting side that improved almost beyond recognition after Klopp replaced Endo and Cody Gakpo with Harvey Elliott and Jota were denied a near certain goal by Botman’s fabulous 11th‑hour sliding, stretching block on Salah. Although Almirón’s swerving left‑foot shot rebounded off the base of a post, Newcastle fans turned fretful. With hindsight Howe would most definitely not have withdrawn the immensely influential Gordon, Joelinton and Tonali during a flurry of second‑half substitutions which self‑destructively ceded control to Liverpool. When Salah and Jota combined to highly intelligent effect even Botman failed to subdue the latter’s pass. The fallout permitted another substitute, Núñez – newly on for Mac Allister – to pounce. Advancing seamlessly, the Uruguayan directed a low drive into the bottom corner, destroying Nick Pope’s hitherto fine afternoon. Howe looked flabbergasted. Then, three minutes into stoppage time, Salah intercepted Bruno Guimarães’s tired pass. Núñez took the Egyptian’s subsequently fine delivery in his stride and, having outpaced Dan Burn, whipped another glorious finish beyond Newcastle’s keeper. As Howe retreated into head-in-hands mode, Klopp indulged in a bout of alpha male chest beating."
Sheffield,1,City,2,Rodri stunner sinks Sheffield United after late scare for Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/27/sheffield-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-27,"Kyle Walker atoned for handing his former club Sheffield United an 85th‑minute equaliser by playing a key role in Rodri’s winner three minutes later as Manchester City extended their flawless start to the defence of their Premier League title. City remain the last top-flight team with a 100% start but this was nothing like as straightforward as their FA Cup semi-final win against these opponents last spring as Paul Heckingbottom’s newly promoted team gave it full throttle after Erling Haaland’s 63rd‑minute opener and even had the audacity to pull level through Jayden Bogle before succumbing to Rodri’s latest key goal. Anyone expecting a routine City win was disabused of the notion as Haaland missed another penalty in the first half to give United hope. But they rallied and for the first time since Pep Guardiola’s first season in charge in 2016 City have won their opening three league games. Still, perhaps the manager, recuperating from back surgery in Barcelona, may contact Walker for a quiet chat after his new captain allowed Bénie Traoré to steal the ball in his own area in the buildup to United’s goal. The danger was only partially cleared and Vini Souza came crashing in to tackle, the ball skewing out wide to Bogle, a substitute, on the right edge of City’s area, to crack a shot past Ederson – and past Oli McBurnie, deemed not to be interfering with the goalkeeper’s sightline – into the far corner. Cue bedlam at Bramall Lane as United sensed they could gain an unlikely first point of the season. Walker hung his head, back at the ground where he made his breakthrough, but picked himself up to make the crucial tackle at the other end, robbing Yasser Larouci of the ball in the far corner, and composed himself to pull a pass back for the substitute Phil Foden. The ball fell back for Rodri, the scorer of City’s Champions League final winner in June, to lash the ball into the top corner. It was a coruscating denouement to a rousing game that will give both teams much encouragement in different ways. Heckingbottom, the United manager, said: “I’m pleased with the performance. The reason I’m so disappointed we’ve lost a point is for the players and the fans – how important that one point will be at the end of the season, who knows – but my focus has to be on the performance.” Juanma Lillo said he would have preferred not to have taken up Guardiola’s seat in the away dugout. “He’s been totally present [in communication] today,” the assistant manager said. “If there’d been more space on the bench, I wouldn’t have sat in his seat on the bench. Pep’s seat is Pep’s seat. Only his [physical] presence was missing today but he was with us for the whole time.” For all their clinical play, City have now missed three of their past five penalties, excluding shootouts, going back to Haaland missing the target in the Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich in April. This latest opportunity came eight minutes before half-time. Julián Álvarez chipped a cross against the arm of John Egan as the United captain went to ground in an attempt to block. Haaland, however, crashed his left-footed shot against the inside of the post as Wes Foderingham dived the other way. United hope they have found the goalscorer to help ignite their survival battle as they introduced Cameron Archer – their eighth summer signing, at £18m from Aston Villa, too late for a debut here – to the crowd before the game. Heckingbottom is expecting to add more new players before the transfer deadline on Friday. Even in this third successive defeat United were game, well organised and had a plan to break on the counter through the front pairing of Traoré and Will Osula. It was after they went behind midway through the second half that the shackles came off. Gustavo Hamer, with a ferocious shot blocked, and then Anel Almedhodzic, firing just over after Ederson punched clear, mustered their first efforts at goal. City dominated without finding full tempo in the first half. Foderingham saved well from Álvarez and a great cross from Walker was begging to be finished at the back post. City had 85% of possession at this stage but the half-time whistle was greeted euphorically by home supporters. The European champions played higher at the start of the second half but every time they missed one of a plethora of chances, the decibel levels just went up as the home crowd scented a narrative moulded to their dreams. Even when City scored, Haaland leaping high at the far post to thud home Jack Grealish’s cross, Bramall Lane immediately rallied with cries of “United, United”. Back came the riposte: “We’re champions of Europe, we score when we want.” Ultimately it seemed they were right, much to Walker’s relief."
Burnley,1,Villa,3,Matty Cash double keeps Aston Villa on a roll in victory at Burnley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/27/burnley-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-27,"We may still be in the early throes of the Premier League season, but there is clearly a lot to like about Unai Emery’s Aston Villa. Legend has it that the team they brushed aside here switched to their present colours of claret and blue in 1910 out of respect for Villa, who were then the champions of England. It would be an overstatement to call Villa title challengers these days. But there is certainly an argument that Burnley showed their opponents too much respect, and that it was decisive in securing back‑to‑back league victories for Villa, while consigning the hosts to a second successive defeat since returning to the top flight. Emery’s side are making an early claim as the league’s great entertainers, too. Their three games have included 14 goals and, after being humbled 5-1 on the opening weekend at Newcastle, they have now scored seven in their past two, conceding one. Here their quality carved Burnley open all too often and the margin of victory could have been greater. Two goals from Matty Cash on his 100th Villa appearance and another from the outstanding Moussa Diaby were ultimately enough to secure victory, though. “It’s more difficult away than at home but we were focused, we were consistent and we were strong,” Emery said. Cash had scored only four times in his previous 99 Villa appearances and his two goals in this game were the culmination of two fantastic passages of play. Villa’s midfield trio of Douglas Luiz, Boubacar Kamara and John McGinn were irrepressible on occasions. The thought of adding Nicolò Zaniolo, who impressed when he came on, to that mix is a mouthwatering one. Burnley conceded after four minutes in their opening match against Manchester City and it took only eight for Villa to break the deadlock. McGinn’s defence-splitting pass released Ollie Watkins who chipped back across goal, allowing Cash to tap into an empty net after James Trafford had rushed out to close down Watkins. The hosts responded with some pressure of their own but they lacked the precision in attack to trouble Villa. So when the visitors burst forward with gusto again midway through the half and Cash doubled the lead after some magnificent interplay between himself and Diaby, you feared the worst for the Vincent Kompany’s side. For Burnley, this was a more effective yardstick in terms of the step up in quality required this season. The defeat by Manchester City offered little in the way of what to expect given the calibre of the opposition and the positive for Kompany was the fact they posed a good Villa side problems on occasions. But the ruthlessness of Villa’s counterattacking underlined how easy it is to be punished at this level. “Learning comes at a price in the Premier League,” Kompany said afterwards. “You could see the quality of the Villa team in the way they took their chances, so credit to them. We’re there in parts, but when you get punished you have to learn from it.” They certainly improved after falling 2-0 behind. There were moments of promise but it was perhaps no surprise when Kompany changed things tactically at the break, and it had an instant reward. Johann Gudmundsson was brought on and within 30 seconds of the restart, Burnley had halved the deficit. The goal came via Lyle Foster, who span Pau Torres well in the box before firing past Robin Olsen. Suddenly Turf Moor was alive, and the hosts continued to pile on the pressure. But just as Burnley were pressing, you always wondered if Villa could strike on the break with the game stretched, and the hour mark provided another decisive moment. As Burnley surged forward, Villa sprung on the counter through McGinn’s superb ball for Lucas Digne. The full-back cut back superbly on the angle for Diaby, who struck a fine finish past Trafford. It was a goal that came at a critical time, and knocked the wind out of Burnley’s sails. The greater moments belonged to Villa in the final quarter too, with Diaby’s strike restoring some semblance of control for the visitors. His final act before being substituted was a wonderful cross for Watkins, who was denied by Trafford, before Zaniolo’s surging run after being introduced from the bench produced another smart save from Trafford. They were opportunities to add further gloss to the scoreline for Villa but the outcome had already been decided. Promising signs for Burnley? Yes, but for Villa supporters another tantalising look at what this season could have in store."
Brentford,1,Palace,1,Joachim Andersen rescues draw for Crystal Palace to deny Brentford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/26/brentford-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-26,"Roy Hodgson hailed Joachim Andersen’s “colossus” performance after the defender’s late equaliser secured a draw for Crystal Palace against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium. Kevin Schade’s stunning opener was cancelled out by Andersen in the 76th minute as Brentford and Palace shared the spoils for a fifth consecutive time in the Premier League. Hodgson lauded the centre-back’s overall performance which nullified the threat of the Brentford duo Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo, who both fired blanks for the first time this season. “I thought Joachim Andersen was the outstanding player today in our team and maybe the outstanding player on the field,” Hodgson said. “I thought he was a colossus today, he won every header in both ends of the field and I thought he won every challenge he went into, he was a leader figure and he drove the team forward. “He wasn’t afraid to come more than midway into the opponent’s half as we saw and he was playing balls and spraying it around from about 25 yards from goal and that was a great responsibility that he took there. “I think it was very fitting that he got the goal, even though it wasn’t a classic.” For the first time this season Brentford appeared lost without focal point Ivan Toney, who is suspended, as they struggled to look threatening in the final third. Thomas Frank highlighted his frustration at his side’s attacking performance and credited Hodgson’s Palace for their defensive efforts. “No [I wasn’t happy with the amount of Brentford chances] but I am not surprised,” Frank said. “For whatever reason and I can’t figure it out, the two teams [Brentford and Palace] cancel each other out more or less in these games. “In five games we’ve played Crystal Palace the amount of chances the two sides have created are very limited and I would have loved to have taken more. “I think in the half opening transitions we lacked the final pass action to create more and we should’ve won 1-0 which is so frustrating.” Schade’s 18th-minute goal was his first for Brentford since his switch from the German club Freiburg in January and Frank talked up the winger’s qualities. “I am so pleased for him, it’s so important for the confidence and what a goal it was,” Frank said. “I loved his initiative to run at the opponent where he got all the way into the box and was composed before a fantastic finish so hopefully he can do more of those nice goals.”"
Brighton,1,West Ham,3,West Ham hit the top after bringing Brighton’s flying start to an abrupt end,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/26/brighton-west-ham-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-26,"West Ham top of the Premier League, their dreadful record against Brighton reaching a spectacular end, and a victory that must register as a tactical triumph for David Moyes. His old-style pragmatism picked apart the new-wave counter-press that has made Roberto De Zerbi the name to drop among football intellectual circles. “Are you watching, Declan Rice?” asked the away fans, a tad ungratefully, as James Ward-Prowse, bought with Rice’s transfer fee, had opened the scoring. Rice’s replacement in defensive midfield, Edson Álvarez, was another outstanding performer. Brighton dominated possession but had no answer to the quality of West Ham’s finishing on the counter, though Alphonse Areola also produced a series of excellent late saves. Lucas Paquetá, who would have joined Rice in exiting the club had other matters not intervened, played creative director, and Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio, the other scorers, showed the ruthlessness in attack Brighton could not emulate. An object lesson for Evan Ferguson, perhaps the next Brighton player to be sold for a nine-figure sum, making his first start of the season? The teenage Irishman was partnered in attack by Danny Welbeck and flanked by two wingers in what often resembled an old-style 4-2-4 formation, De Zerbi again ripping up the rule books, though this time the Italian’s free-form experimentalism ended up sounding an atonal note. “We can’t forget that we lost three important players,” said De Zerbi, highlighting his club’s summer of sales. “We can lose because we are Brighton.” Moyes admitted: “We had to defend a lot. Let’s not kid ourselves, it is a part of football and it is not all about attacking. The last couple of games, we have defended really well as a team. Hopefully we improve and the football gets better.” Álvarez, making his Hammers debut, fulfilled the deep-lying role that was once Rice’s, though without the forward surges of the former captain. Early on, a couple of flashes from Paquetá signalled the danger of Brighton’s risk-taking. First, the Brazilian looped a header over, and then, employing the vision that had Pep Guardiola coveting his services, picked out Antonio with a pass the lone striker should have done better with. Antonio soon enough played supplier of West Ham’s first-half goal. Adam Webster lost the ball, then tussled with Antonio on the touchline to end up in a terrible mess before Ward-Prowse scored his first West Ham goal – his 50th in the Premier League – at the second attempt. “A lot of effort went in the gameplan, you have to respect Brighton,” said the goalscorer, thriving in new surroundings. “We executed our gameplan perfectly today.” West Ham’s stolid determination was such that in the 30th minute they had completed just 13 passes to Brighton’s 220. “They are unique,” said Moyes. “The manager here has done incredible things with the team and we had to find a way to stop incredible things happening.” His first-half plan could hardly have worked better, and after the break both Bowen and Antonio blew decent chances before getting on the scoresheet within four minutes of each other. Paquetá also attempted a volley that Bart Verbruggen saved well. There was no such chance for Brighton’s Dutch goalie, 21 and another making his debut, with West Ham’s second goal. Created by Saïd Benrahma’s brilliant control, and his taking a beat before playing in Bowen to kill the ball and angle the finish, it was an absolute beauty. Next came Antonio’s strike, with less artistic impression but deserved after an expert display in leading the line. This time it was Bowen’s touch and expression that created the chance before Antonio bullied Webster – again – before the move’s completion. “In the second half, we lost the balance,” said De Zerbi. “We made some crucial and important mistakes in the first and third goals.” Pascal Gross’s low finish reduced the deficit and gave rise to faint hopes of a comeback. Brighton again dominated possession but as 90 minutes loomed, Joël Veltman’s volley was well saved by Areola who next made an even better stop from Ferguson. “He didn’t half pull off a couple of worldy saves,” said Moyes. “The best player on the pitch,” lamented De Zerbi. Maintaining the two-goal margin was enough to put the Hammers top of the table."
Everton,0,Wolves,1,Everton hit rock bottom as Sasa Kalajdzic snatches points for Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/26/everton-wolves-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-26,"Sean Dyche had rubbished suggestions that no points and no goals from the first two games of the season constituted a crisis at Everton. Well, they are in one now. The Wolves substitute Sasa Kalajdzic scored an 87th-minute winner moments after being introduced to deliver his club’s first points of the campaign. Everton have lost their opening three matches for the first time in 33 years and, once again, have only themselves to blame. As was the case against Fulham, another winnable home match against modest opposition disintegrated into another avoidable defeat after Dyche’s side squandered a host of chances. There were positives for the Everton manager to cling to. Two youngsters, Jarrad Branthwaite and Lewis Dobbin, impressed on their first starts under Dyche while new signing Youssef Chermiti showed promising movement up front. But his team remain abject in front of goal and two home games that must be won to avoid a repeat of recent relegation struggles have yielded only torment. This is a large crisis, to use the old line from Blackadder. And just like Blackadder’s response to a crisis, throwing Michael Keane on as an emergency striker in the 90th minute was the Premier League equivalent of putting two pencils up the nose and a pair of underpants on the head. No wonder the club are close to signing the Udinese forward Beto for £26m. Gary O’Neil could introduce an Austria international in Kalajdzic for extra firepower in the closing minutes. With a deft glance of the head the striker who missed much of his debut season at Wolves with an knee injury made the perfect impact. “It was as bad as Fulham in the sense of us creating high quality chances and taking none,” the Everton manager lamented. “It’s not just the strikers, it’s the team. Their keeper was man of the match again and we shouldn’t be making them the man of the match. You have to ask questions about why we are not taking these chances and I have.” Everton paid a moving tribute before kick off and in the 26th minute to Michael Jones, the 26-year-old Evertonian who died in an accident at the club’s new stadium recently. Applause was still reverberating around Goodison Park when James Tarkowski missed an excellent chance to put the hosts ahead, slicing wide after José Sá had swept the ball off Branthwaite’s toes and straight to his defensive partner. Sa had earlier tipped a shot from full debutant Arnaut Danjuma onto a post after the on-loan forward had been played clean through by Amadou Onana. Danjuma was flagged offside but it would have been a close call for VAR had he converted. Wolves were anaemic before the break and vastly improved after it with Pedro Neto, Hugo Bueno and the substitute Rayan Aït-Nouri prominent down the flanks. Fábio Silva flicked a neat finish past Jordan Pickford from a low Bueno cross but was just offside. Moments later he found himself bearing down on Pickford’s goal following a calamitous mix-up between Tarkowski and the Everton goalkeeper but fired badly wide. Pickford reacted superbly to save on his goalline after Neto’s free-kick struck Branthwaite and almost yielded an own goal. Sá did even better to somehow tip over a diving header from Abdoulaye Doucouré. The midfielder was completely unmarked when James Garner threaded a delightful cross through the Wolves defence. Doucouré fluffed the connection, and should have scored, but his header was still bouncing beyond Sá when the keeper managed to flick the ball up and over his crossbar at full stretch. Doucouré beat Sá when collecting another Garner pass and cutting across Michael Dawson before rolling a finish into the far corner. Everton celebrations were cut short by an offside flag, a decision that was backed up after a lengthy review by the VAR. With five minutes remaining O’Neil introduced Kalajdzic for Matheus Cunha. Two minutes later he ghosted between the static Tarkowski and Patterson to steer a glancing header from Neto’s deep cross into the bottom corner. It was Wolves’ first effort on target of the game and a dream moment for the Austrian after his injury troubles. For Everton, however, the nightmare continues."
Arsenal,2,Fulham,2,João Palhinha stuns Arsenal as 10-man Fulham battle back to earn late point,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/26/arsenal-fulham-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-26,"On a wild, storm-racked afternoon, Arsenal and Fulham played out a draw that felt by the end like three games in one, as well as at least two different, largely opposed tactical versions of this Arsenal team. Fulham were neat, sparky and compact in central midfield. They took the lead via the first attack of the game, then equalised with two minutes left of normal time and 10 players left on the pitch after Calvin Bassey’s late second yellow card. In between Fulham exposed for long periods the weaknesses in Mikel Arteta’s attempts to reconfigure his team in these early days of the league season. Thomas Partey may or may not be an instinctive positional postmodernist, able to slip into a fluid right-back-midfield role. But there was very little evidence of it here and his 55 minutes on the pitch felt like time lost pursuing an under-researched experiment. For Arteta this was a messy game, one that will draw accusations of tactical egotism, Pep-mimesis, of forgetting that what Arsenal need above all in these early games is confirmation that last season’s progress was real, that hard-won Premier League points are the necessary bedrock of whatever tactical jazz Arsenal’s manager might succeed in introducing. He was understandably defiant, blaming the result on an early mistake for Fulham’s opening goal. “We were 10 times better than last season [against Fulham], at least 10 times better. Last season, we won 2-1 in the last minute, this time we drew 2-2. This is football.” The stadium had been a boisterous, hopeful place before kick-off under chilly August skies. But it was reduced to baffled silence after 57 seconds as Fulham took the lead with a goal that was farcical and supremely well executed. Bukayo Saka’s attempted pass back into his own defence emerged instead as the perfect through ball for an unmarked Andreas Pereira. The finish was also excellent, Pereira spotting Aaron Ramsdale scrabbling about trying to gauge the danger in the middle and curling the ball inside the near post, a lovely piece of improvisation. Arsenal’s instant response was frantic. There were high looped crosses towards Leandro Trossard, who came in for Eddie Nketiah up front, some defiantly urgent crossfield switches and, above all, a sense of self-induced struggle. Kai Havertz looked unremittingly confused, not just by his role on the left of midfield, but by the basic fact of taking part in a Premier League match. “He got in great areas but the ball didn’t arrive,” was Arteta’s verdict. Partey started at right-back again, stepping into midfield alongside Declan Rice when Fulham had the ball. Even in this more natural role he seemed always wary of Pereira sniping into that outside-left position, so hesitant at times you expected to look down and notice he was still thumbing through the manual on how to play this position, thumbing the index, wondering why it is all in Swedish. It is hard to blame Partey for this. Very few players are able to step in and fill such a complex role without glitches. Steadily, Arsenal began to apply the expected chokehold, creating the kind of chances that often leave you wishing for the razor edge of a specialist finisher. They had 72% possession and eight shots at goal in the first half, but still looked like they were playing with their shoes on the wrong feet. Nketiah replaced Trossard at half-time. For a while, Saka played through a kind of rage on the right, whirling and jinking and throwing himself at the Fulham backline. Partey left the pitch on 55 minutes, replaced by Oleksandr Zinchenko at left-back, shifting Ben White back across and instantly giving Arsenal a more balanced look. Havertz was replaced by Fábio Vieira and it was he who forced the breakthrough for the equaliser, zipping in from the left and drawing Kenny Tete into a wild sliding challenge. Saka took the penalty, a little odd given Martin Ødegaard’s precision last week. But as ever with Saka and penalties this had an element of destiny, redemption, vibes. He buried it to level the scores and give Arsenal a 20-minute run at victory. They needed two to take the lead. Again, there was fine work from Vieira, measuring a perfect low cross into the path of Nketiah. “He looks a real threat at the moment. He’s full of confidence. There is a fire in the eyes,” Arteta said of a player he left on the bench. Fulham were not finished, however. Their equaliser was a wonderful finish by the excellent João Palhinha, arrowing the ball into the far corner from Harrison Reed’s corner. They could have won it had Adama Traoré’s finishing been anywhere near the level of his running power right at the death, a story as old as his professional career. But a draw felt fair, and salutary too on a day when Arsenal resembled a side still unravelling the snags in their own system."
United,3,Forest,2,Manchester United storm back to beat 10-man Forest with Fernandes spot-on,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/26/manchester-united-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-26,"Manchester United continue to lurch and flail through this early phase of the season. A victory from two-nil down appears admirably scrapped for but they should never have allowed this deficit four minutes in. It points to a fragility that will concern the manager and is a puzzle as Erik ten Hag had all of last season to ensure his side do not resemble a bunch of strangers who may find the right wavelength to prosper or may not. On this occasion they did – just about. The winner came from the one footballer Ten Hag can rely on – Bruno Fernandes, whose 76th-minute penalty beat Matt Turner to the goalkeeper’s right and came after Marcus Rashford claimed the kick by drawing Danilo into a clumsy foul on the right of his area. Fernandes was effervescent throughout. An earlier run on to Casemiro’s raking pass caused Joe Worrall to yank United’s captain down and Nottingham Forest’s leader was sent off, the score then 2-2. A defeat or a draw and United could have been written up as entering their latest crisis, with one win from three, a slew of injuries including the £72m new striker who is yet to feature (Rasmus Højlund) and the sense that another season may prove long and arduous. Throw in the latest anti-Glazer protest, a sit-in against the American owners after the final whistle that drew a sizable number, and this would have been one of those dark days synonymous with the decade since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. While this did not happen – André Onana beat out a late Willy Boly shot to ensure the win – United’s start was a disaster and a farce. Ten Hag chose his own characterisation. “It is a horror start,” he said. “Giving them two goals but I am very pleased with the comeback, the leadership, how we stayed composed and stuck to the plans and [had] belief.” Of Fernandes, he said: “In all aspects, he played a game at the highest level, so I’m happy with his performance.” Forest’s goals came from dead balls and should have been avoided. The first followed a home corner Fernandes swung in from the left, Brennan Johnson cleared, Aaron Wan-Bissaka was soporific in challenging Morgan Gibbs-White and Taiwo Awoniyi took over. He was in his own half but, barging aside a slumbering Rashford, raced upfield. Onana retreated when he might have advanced and the striker ran into the area to score in a seventh successive league appearance. Cut to Casemiro imploring his teammates to retain their cool. Then cut to Casemiro ball-watching when Gibbs-White fired in a free-kick – needlessly conceded by Diogo Dalot – from the right, the Brazilian’s ponderousness allowing Boly to head in. United had to rally and did via Christian Eriksen’s first of the season, which came after Turner failed to steer Fernandes’s long-range potshot to safety. Anthony Martial, restored as centre-forward, tapped the ball to Rashford and he beat Scott McKenna down the left and pinged it over for Eriksen’s poacher’s finish. The home congregation upped the volume and the chants of “You’re getting sacked in the morning” (aimed at Ten Hag) from the Forest supporters were quelled. As rain poured down the Dutchman reached for the cagoule and saw Casemiro commit another mistake: a Fernandes corner bounced to the midfielder who headed wide. Casemiro was again in the dock for jogging back as Gibbs-White was put in behind. An instant ball would have offered a tap-in but he dawdled and those in red escaped. United’s response was spirited due to Fernandes, who was in dynamo mode, probing along the flanks, chasing back and flicking crossfield passes. He was let down by colleagues who failed to pick up runners and, on the stroke of half-time, the unattended Gibbs-White should have smashed in a third Forest goal. Casemiro redeemed himself with the equaliser. Fernandes pulled a free-kick back to Rashford on the left near Forest’s D. The ball was returned to the captain, whose header was cushioned on a Brazilian leg and punched in. After Fernandes put United ahead, Anthony Elanga sprinted down the left and teed up Chris Wood, but he missed and United clung on through the 14 minutes of added time. Steve Cooper was unhappy with Worrall’s sending off and United’s penalty award. “I’m not going to talk too much as I don’t want to get into trouble,” he said. Ten Hag would not comment on a proposed Crystal Palace move for Dean Henderson, with Fenerbahce’s Altay Bayindir reportedly to replace United’s second-choice keeper."
Bournemouth,0,Spurs,2,James Maddison on target as stylish Spurs ease to victory at Bournemouth,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/26/bournemouth-tottenham-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-26,"It is a sight Tottenham hope will become commonplace this season, James Maddison mimicking stepping up to the oche after finding the net. Maddison capped a wonderful team move to open the scoring here, headed towards the nearest corner flag and then exhibited his go-to celebration for the first time in the pristine all-white Spurs strip. Son Heung-min and Pape Matar Sarr joined him for another impromptu performance, straight down the lens of the pitchside TV camera. A dartboard is usually part of Maddison’s luggage on away trips and his scruffy first-half finish was the catalyst for Spurs’ first win on the road in this new era under Ange Postecoglou. Dejan Kulusevski made sure of the points with a deft second-half finish. Victory also allows Postecoglou to at least consider enjoying his 58th birthday on Sunday, in between preparing for Tuesday’s Carabao Cup trip to Fulham. “We always put birthday celebrations on hold depending on my result, so I’m sure my wife is now scrambling to arrange something,” the Tottenham manager said, raising a smile. Maddison trained on Friday for the first time since leaving Tottenham’s victory over Manchester United last Saturday on crutches owing to an ankle complaint yet he was anything but suppressed here. His influence waned a little in the second half as Bournemouth pushed for an equaliser but his quick feet and thinking helped Spurs win the midfield battle. Maddison thrives when the protagonist or, indeed, the pantomime villain. In the first half he pointed to the scoreboard as a home supporter gave him some grief. “It’s all a bit of theatre,” Postecoglou said. If Maddison was influential, so, too, were Yves Bissouma and Sarr, both of whom were involved in the slick passage of play that led to Spurs seizing the lead on 17 minutes. Bissouma dialled up the intensity and burst inside before locating Sarr, who spied Maddison on the move. It was a sumptuous pass and Maddison promptly stroked the ball past Neto in the Bournemouth goal with the slightest touch off his right boot. Postecoglou raised both arms in celebration. On this evidence Maddison is a £40m bargain, even if that tag made Postecoglou wince a little. “There wasn’t anyone happier than me when we got him,” he said. “I would not say ‘surprised’ but I am overjoyed at the footballer I’ve got. He works hard, he wins the ball back for us, it’s not like he’s out there and just comes to life when we’ve got the ball. “There’s more to come. Once he gets more understanding with his teammates, particularly the forward players, he’s going to keep improving. I’m delighted we’ve got him.” Spurs should have extended their lead in the first half, long before Kulusevski doubled their advantage in the second. Richarlison dropped a header wide from a corner and had a shot blocked by Joe Rothwell after a rapid counterattack. Destiny Udogie was given the freedom of Bournemouth and after reaching the byline, played a give-and-go with Son. Ivan Perisic, who replaced Sarr, released Udogie and he pinged the ball across goal, where Kulusevski was quickest to nip in front of Lloyd Kelly and flick the ball into the far corner. Every outfield Spurs player joined the huddle of celebrations. Postecoglou was unmoved. It was a timely intervention from Kulusevski given the visitors had begun to cede control. Postecoglou replaced Richarlison with Pierre-Emile Højbjerg, among a number of first-team players for sale. Richarlison had another frustrating time leading the line, typified by a few seconds early in the second half. The Brazilian ended up on his backside after inadvertently standing on the ball attempting to latch on to an infield Pedro Porro pass and instantly earned a booking for petulantly tripping Ryan Christie in a bid to vent his anger. Christie forced Guglielmo Vicario into a save from outside the box in the first half and Antoine Semenyo hit a stanchion with a first-time shot approaching the hour but Tottenham were never truly rattled. The substitute Jaidon Anthony’s daisy-cutter from distance spoke to the hosts’ lack of threat. This was, however, another promising outing for Postecoglou and this new-look Spurs. “We’ve got our Tottenham back,” cheered the away support as the final whistle loomed."
Chelsea,3,Luton,0,Raheem Sterling waltzes through Luton to set up Pochettino’s first Chelsea win ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/25/chelsea-luton-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-25,"When Raheem Sterling is smiling on a football pitch, many of the world’s troubles seem to, temporarily at least, fade. It certainly felt that way at Stamford Bridge, a goal in each half plus an assist for Nicolas Jackson, ensuring Mauricio Pochettino’s Chelsea side have their first victory. After a disappointing first season for Chelsea, Sterling looks light, zippy and to be enjoying his football again. For all the recent talk of £100m midfield enforcers – of whom Chelsea have a pair – Sterling was the attacker cheap at half the price. Luton were among those dazzled. “He deserves the full credit for his performance,” said Pochettino. “He told me last season was difficult for him. I’m very pleased the player is happy.” The night’s headliner was supposed to be Moisés Caicedo, a recent addition from Brighton in a British record £115m transfer. Yet as much as Caicedo ticked along at the midfield’s base, and Enzo Fernández enjoyed the freedom of a more advanced role, Sterling outshone them both. His first came early. From wide on the right, a quick stepover and Sterling was jinking inside Ryan Giles. On the half-beat, his left-shoulder dropped, and a shot low shot placed into the corner. It was equal parts football and ballroom dancing. Sterling’s second arrived after Chelsea, himself included, had been wasteful after the break. But when, with just over 20 minutes remaining, he met Malo Gusto’s centre with a neat finish, Stamford Bridge exhaled in unison. The icing on the evening’s cake came with Jackson’s first goal for Chelsea, with Sterling this time the provider. “I had a conversation with the gaffer earlier last week, we’ve gone through the role, and I know exactly what he needs from me and it’s as simple as that,” Sterling said. “I need to get on the back foot and do what I do, drive at players and get on it. That’s when I’m most effective.” “I came in a difficult period, that’s all finished. I think the most important thing, I’ve had a look at myself and I’m a person who always tries to analyse what I’ve been doing, what I’ve done wrong, what I can change. “It’s as simple as that, I want to get back to being obsessed with football. Just football 24/7 and nothing else. [I want to] focus on top performances and goals and assists.” As Kerry Dixon put it at half-time, Chelsea are a “work in progress”. Yet unlike last season, there is a clear direction of travel under Pochettino. If the feeling had been that early results had not tallied with performances – and given the only changes Pochettino has made to three Premier League starting lineups have been injury enforced, he seems to hold that view – this ticked a few boxes. They were slick, most of the time at least. It was death by a thousand triangles, Sterling seemingly at the tip of each of them. Jackson was excellent, Fernández too. “It is only the first step,” said Pochettino. Patience is required. His young side will err at times. “The process is really important, as is time to work,” he added. “To create the links, the way we want to play, the animation, we need time.” This was a difficult night for Luton. No lack of guts but little by way of guile. They had one chance, one potential moment that might have turned events. Only one behind on the hour, Stamford Bridge felt edgy. Luton, and their vociferous followers, sensed it. A rare foray into the penalty area ended with Giles striking hard. Robert Sánchez’s palm, fortunately for Chelsea, was strong. But while there are no free hits, these are not the evenings on which Rob Edwards, in his heart of hearts, will focus most attention. Because the majority of the time, Goliath wins. It is just that nobody likes to spin that story. “We don’t like losing,” said Edwards. “But I can accept it when there’s a performance like that.” It is little wonder Edwards spoke with glowing pride, really. Because the difference in fiscal outlay here is astonishing. It can be neatly visualised like this: whereas fans who visit Kenilworth Road must locate their turnstile lurking between terraced houses, Luton’s travelling supporters had a pair of four-star hotels to guide them towards their Friday night perches. Luton; Chelsea. Paupers; kings. In football terms, anyway. Since Todd Boehly’s summer 2022 takeover, Chelsea have spent close to 10 figures on a squad overhaul. They will likely reach that tipping point before September, with Pochettino saying afterwards that – although he believes Jackson has the potential to be one of the league’s best – with Romelu Lukaku seemingly Roma bound, he still wants to sign one more forward. So, what price a regulation home victory? Nearly a billion pounds ought to do it, it seems."
Palace,0,Arsenal,1,Ødegaard edges Arsenal to win at Crystal Palace despite Tomiyasu red,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/21/crystal-palace-arsenal-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-21,"There was, as the saying goes, little for the end-of-season highlights reel here. Arsenal will not mind, given they navigated their way through an almighty scrap, and the celebrations of their coaching staff at the end were a reminder that the points are ultimately what matter. A refashioned side has not yet approached last season’s footballing heights but the time to draw any conclusions remains far off. Two victories from two, however they have come, give Mikel Arteta some reassurance they have rediscovered the winning habit that escaped them in the spring. Perhaps opponents with a full suite of senior forwards would have punished them after Takehiro Tomiyasu was dismissed midway through the second half. Arsenal had broken through eight minutes after the interval through Martin Ødegaard’s penalty and looked in full control until the defender was harshly shown a second yellow card for fouling Jordan Ayew. Crystal Palace barely have a kitchen sink to reach for but threw what they could at their depleted visitors, missing a couple of half-chances, and Arsenal were visibly relieved when the final whistle came. “I loved it, absolutely loved it,” Arteta said of a performance in which his side, packed with defenders by the end, did the dirty stuff to perfection late on. “We played the way we wanted to against 11 men. Then we had to play half an hour with 10 men, which is a contest we didn’t prepare for. The players had to adapt but they were fantastic, I don’t think we gave anything away.” Arsenal looked in total control, far likelier to score a second than find themselves pegged back, when Ayew spun Tomiyasu on the right flank near halfway and went to ground. Contact appeared accidental at best, although with yards of space in front of him there was little obvious reason for Ayew to dive. David Coote reached for his pocket and, because he had already booked Tomiyasu for timewasting at a throw-in, gave himself little option but to inflict the ultimate punishment. “I prefer not to make comments because for me it’s so obvious,” said Arteta, unable to resist offering his view on the second booking. He was also unimpressed by Coote’s response to the earlier incident, disagreeing when it was put to him that Tomiyasu had held on to the ball for 23 seconds. “It wasn’t, I think it was eight seconds,” he said. “We might have to play with a stopwatch.” Roy Hodgson had his own reservations about the sequence that gave Arsenal the breakthrough they had threatened either side of half-time. Eddie Nketiah had missed two clear chances but showed up for a third when Gabriel Martinelli, thinking quickly, slipped him through with a quick free-kick. He was sharper to the ball than Sam Johnstone, who indisputably sent him flying, but Hodgson was surprised a subsequent VAR check did not go Palace’s way. Thomas Partey appeared to block Jefferson Lerma’s attempt to cover the pass from Martinelli but the contact was deemed insufficient. “I’ve seen the video replays and there’s a block,” Hodgson said. “There was a player designated to get in that area and stop that free-kick and he couldn’t do so.” Nonetheless Ødegaard sent Johnstone the wrong way and Arsenal deserved to lead, even if Nketiah had continued to keep everyone guessing about his true level. When Bukayo Saka prodded him through on the half-hour he was razor sharp to see off two defenders but rolled his finish against the far post. Shortly afterwards Declan Rice, who had a fine game, released him cleverly only for a dinked effort from inside the six-yard box to clear the bar. Palace had looked marginally the more incisive early on, Eberechi Eze making Aaron Ramsdale save from range and Odsonne Édouard seeing a mazy run foiled by Ben White. Occasionally Ayew would cause trouble down the right but Hodgson’s attacking resources are scarce now that Wilfried Zaha has departed and Michael Olise, hailed in song by the crowd for rejecting Chelsea, remains injured. Jean-Philippe Mateta, linked with a move away, might have offered a useful spearhead off the bench but Hodgson said he had reported sick with a sore knee. Their bluntness made for a flurry of huff and puff as the minutes ticked down, Édouard fluffing a presentable header and Tyrick Mitchell blasted wildly over with the headlines awaiting him at the death. “I don’t know if I could have asked much more of the players,” Hodgson said. Both teams had arguably caught each other at a good time, but Arsenal made the opportunity count."
West Ham,3,Chelsea,1,Antonio and Paquetá down Chelsea to give 10-man West Ham victory,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/20/west-ham-chelsea-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-20,"Spending close to £1bn in the space of a year has not stopped Chelsea from making the same old mistakes. They were dominant for long stretches at the London Stadium, their football easy on the eye, but the defence remained frail, the missed chances piled up and a team packed with promising youngsters fell to a first defeat under Mauricio Pochettino after a ruthless and resilient West Ham once again proved that life under David Moyes is by no means dull. Against the odds, a feisty contest ended with Lucas Paquetá shielding the ball deep on the left and tormenting Chelsea with his flicks and tricks. West Ham’s No 10 enjoyed himself, quashing fears that he would not be in a mental state to play after the revelation that he is being investigated by the Football Association for potential betting breaches, and showed why he was a target for Manchester City. Moisés Caicedo could not get close to Paquetá. It ended as a debut to forget for Caicedo, who conceded the penalty from which Paquetá made it 3-1 deep into added time. Chelsea’s £115m signing had stepped off the bench with his new side in trouble, breached at the start of the second half when Michail Antonio punished Axel Disasi by restoring West Ham’s lead, but his impact was minimal. There has been so much change at Chelsea and, while there were some positives for Pochettino, all that money is yet to create a cohesive unit. Perhaps that was why Chelsea crumbled after Antonio’s goal, offering little in the final third even after West Ham were reduced to 10 men when their centre-back Nayef Aguerd picked up a second booking with 23 minutes left. West Ham had more nous and they could delight in their new midfielder James Ward‑Prowse outshining Caicedo by filling the void left by Declan Rice’s departure and marking his debut with two fine assists. “He did a great job,” Moyes said. “We played against a really good Chelsea team. To come away with a positive result was enormous.” It was not long before Ward-Prowse was showing why Moyes, who said he had no doubt about starting Paquetá, fought so hard to sign him. It almost felt unfair, a side with West Ham’s record at set pieces adding Ward‑Prowse to their armoury, and Chelsea immediately looked nervous. They survived the first corner from Ward-Prowse, Robert Sanchez denying Tomas Soucek, but not the next. Conor Gallagher did not even get off the ground as Aguerd headed past Sanchez. “I am so disappointed with the first goal,” Pochettino said. The frustration gnawed at Chelsea’s head coach. Pochettino was pleased with his side’s response to the early setback, Carney Chukwuemeka levelling with a stunning goal, but there was criticism for Mykhailo Mudryk, the £88.5m winger failing to take his chance after coming on at half-time. “I think he needs to be more desperate to score,” Pochettino said of Mudryk, who is yet to score since joining Chelsea. There was one opening for Mudryk when Chelsea were chasing a late equaliser but his volley almost went out for a throw. Pochettino, no doubt, will note that there was far more balance before the Ukrainian replaced the injured Chukwuemeka. Chelsea were superior during the first half, attacking at speed, and Enzo Fernández was soon threatening with a lovely pass through to Nicolas Jackson, who looked for a penalty after being fouled by Alphonse Areola. West Ham were relieved to see that Jackson had already been flagged offside but the striker was keeping Aguerd and Kurt Zouma worried. Chelsea pushed and Jackson, who has to be more clinical, headed over. The equaliser was coming and it arrived when a poor clearance from Zouma fell to Chukwuemeka. The 19-year-old beat Soucek and lashed in his first goal. The mood shifted and Chelsea should have been ahead when Soucek chopped Raheem Sterling down. Fernández’s technique betrayed him, though, and Areola saved the Argentinian’s penalty. West Ham sought to capitalise on Fernández’s profligacy, Paquetá hitting the woodwork, and emerged with more intensity in the second half. They threatened when Malo Gusto, deputising for the injured Reece James at right-back, lost Saïd Benrahma. Then Disasi’s slack pass allowed Ward-Prowse to release Antonio, who shoved Levi Colwill aside and smashed past Sanchez from 20 yards. Only now did Pochettino turn to Caicedo and there was another twist when Aguerd departed. Yet Moyes simply responded to going down to 10 men by stiffening his defence, Angelo Ogbonna coming on, and West Ham locked it down. Noni Madueke threatened with a deflected shot after coming on but Chelsea had few ideas and Paquetá came alive. Deep into added time the Brazilian’s backheel found Emerson Palmieri and in lunged Caicedo. It was over to Paquetá to finish Chelsea off and leave Pochettino waiting for his first win of the season."
Villa,4,Everton,0,Aston Villa rampant as Jhon Durán tops off victory against hapless Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/20/aston-villa-everton-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-20,"If there was a moment that summed up the festering frustrations among Everton supporters then it arrived on 38 minutes, by which point this bludgeoning was already as good as over. Dominic Calvert-Lewin headed for the tunnel holding an ice pack to his face after reporting blurred vision after an earlier collision with Emiliano Martínez and a section of travelling fans jeered his premature exit. Calvert-Lewin, who was not fit enough to feature on the opening weekend but completed a rare 90 minutes in a friendly on Tuesday, responded by sarcastically raising a thumb at the fans by way of thanks and muttered a few words under his breath. For the second successive season, Everton have zero points from their opening two matches. The painful reality is Aston Villa wiped the floor with Everton. This fixture is the most played in English league history, the game their 211th top-flight meeting, but on this evidence Everton have much work to do to ensure a repeat of this trip next season. It seemed Sean Dyche’s side might even get off lightly until the Villa substitute Jhon Durán scored with his first touches on 75 minutes. Ashley Young arrived on to the pitch with two of his children, his youngest blowing kisses towards the away support, which was sparse long before full time. Young, who was released by Villa at the end of last season, received a warm ovation from the Holte End after the final whistle but those Everton fans will remember his afternoon for the long throw that led to Villa’s fourth. Young sold Michael Keane short and Durán nipped in to nick the ball and calmly slotted past Jordan Pickford. For Villa, this was some reaction to what Unai Emery described as an embarrassing opening-day 5-1 trouncing at Newcastle. Emery dedicated the victory to Tyrone Mings and Emi Buendía, who are unlikely to play again this season after both sustained anterior cruciate ligament injuries. It was an afternoon to forget for the Everton goalkeeper, who conceded a first-half penalty which allowed Douglas Luiz to double Villa’s lead inside 25 minutes. Pickford caught Ollie Watkins with a wild punch, a left hook as the striker attempted to convert from close range and while James Tarkowski hacked the ball clear, the Everton captain’s goalline clearance proved in vain. If Everton were bad, Villa were barnstorming. They had earned a corner within 13 seconds and after 18 minutes the captain, John McGinn, had got the ball rolling, side-footing in a neat volley after Moussa Diaby combined with Leon Bailey. It should have been 3-0 on 26 minutes, at which point all sides of this stadium partook in a minute’s applause for Michael Jones, the 26-year-old construction worker who lost his life at the site of Everton’s Bramley-Moore Dock stadium on Monday. Bailey chopped inside Idrissa Gueye, the former Villa midfielder, but Diaby’s shot from Douglas Luiz’s layoff was tame. The same could not be said for Diaby’s next effort, a rip-roaring volley that smacked a post via Pickford’s left glove. Villa supporters gasped as replays were shown on the big screens. Villa were rampant and should have been out of sight before half-time. Everton finally registered their first shot on target into nine minutes of first-half added time when Arnaut Danjuma, who replaced Calvert-Lewin, latched on to a neat reverse pass by Nathan Patterson. The restless Everton support vocalised their feelings, as did the scattered few that remained at the end. Young, Keane and Tarkowski applauded those who had stuck around. “It looked too lackadaisical, like people were waiting for someone else to ignite it,” Dyche said. “And they looked like a side who had lots of players looking to affect the game. We were miles off it. There’s no magic wand – there never was when I took the job – and there are no shortcuts, because shortcuts in football usually cost a lot of money.” Lucas Digne’s quick-thinking was the catalyst for Villa’s third. The former Everton left-back launched the ball into a huge hole in the visitors’ 18-yard box and by the time the defence had cottoned on, Keane inadvertently helped the ball into the path of Bailey, who stroked his shot through the legs of Pickford. The ball rippled the net while the stadium announcer was still reading aloud the name of Neal Maupay, the Everton substitute who at least tested Martínez with a volley but is now 29 appearances without a goal. Maupay replaced Alex Iwobi, who pulled up after stretching to reach an Amadou Onana pass three minutes into the second half. As Iwobi hobbled down the tunnel, Villa quietly exhibited their newfound strength in depth: Youri Tielemans, Philippe Coutinho and Diego Carlos limbered up on the touchline. Coutinho was forced off late on with a suspected hamstring problem but the damage had already long since been inflicted on a damning afternoon. “I could have taken the whole team off at half-time,” Dyche said. “We have to make sure that we learn from that very quickly.”"
City,1,Newcastle,0,Manchester City in comfort zone as Julián Álvarez sinks Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/manchester-city-newcastle-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-19,"In the absence of Kevin De Bruyne, Manchester City will need players to replace his quality. Step forward, Phil Foden. The midfielder has been an important part of the squad for years, often doing his best work on the flanks but now he has the opportunity to shine in the middle. Julián Álvarez’s goal settled the win over Newcastle but Foden was at the heart of City’s victory. Foden created enough chances for City to have won by more but poor finishing kept the margin to one against a Newcastle side who struggled to lay a glove on the hosts, who completed a 17th home victory in a row. “This is the second game of the season but it is proof of the reason why we won a lot,” Pep Guardiola said. “The mindset and mentality of this group of players amazes me every time, surprises me every time. Against that team and the conditions, we arrive with a lot of injuries and no rest. They played really well, how they defend and how they run and the commitment of everyone was absolutely amazing.” Positions and formations are an outdated concept in elite football. Foden started on the right wing but acted more as an auxiliary No 10, drifting in to find space and affect the game where he wants to. On the other flank Jack Grealish could be found in the left-back position when City had possession in their own half. Guardiola looked to lure Newcastle into a false sense of security, before allowing Grealish and Kyle Walker to attack out wide. Newcastle accepted the best way to stop City was to have a flat five in midfield and afford little space between them and the defence. In the early stages, 10 Newcastle players could be found in their own box, desperately working to keep City at bay. Eddie Howe had organised his side well and it worked for half an hour. The inevitable happened when Mateo Kovacic slipped a pass through to Foden into the space he naturally finds. The England international took a touch in the area and laid it to Álvarez, allowing the striker to control the ball and take aim across Nick Pope into the top corner. The goalkeeper got a hand to the shot but will feel he should have done better. As Newcastle tired, more space was opening up for Foden to work in – he was showing why he deserves to be playing centrally. Without De Bruyne, City need a freeflowing and confident Foden to make the difference in tight games. He created a fine chance for Haaland, starting with a dynamic one-two inside the Newcastle half before slipping the ball into the Norwegian, who dragged his shot inches wide. The thought of Foden and Haaland being on the same wavelength will put fear into opposing defences. “Phil has incredible ability between the lines; the way he turns and attacks the last lines, it is one of the best I have seen. He doesn’t need two or three touches. We thought for the way Newcastle defend we can find him,” Guardiola said. “We are not at our best but it is completely normal. Today the biggest difference is the team showed me we are ready to try it again.” City are often slow starters in the league and are certainly a long way off their best but they have controlled their two league matches. Newcastle were a more difficult opposition than Burnley but were completely nullified, earning a single shot on target, an impressive feat considering Howe’s side opened up with five goals against Aston Villa. “They [City] are there [winning titles] for a reason and a top team and it is our job to close that gap,” Howe said. “I was angry at half-time because I hadn’t seen exactly what I wanted to see. I know we can perform better so I am disappointed. You have to be at your very best to get something.”"
Spurs,2,United,0,Sarr strike and Martínez own goal give Spurs edge against Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/tottenham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-19,"When the board went up to signal nine minutes of added time, the thought was of what Manchester United could do in that period. Lads, it’s Tottenham, a team who in living memory threw away a 3-0 half-time lead against United to lose 5-3. After which, nothing. No surge, no siege, no sense of jeopardy. The game had been done even before Lisandro Martínez’s 83rd-minute own goal; for the final half-hour they offered nothing. That, inevitably, shapes the perception. For the first hour, the game had ebbed and flowed. Chances here, mistakes there. In total there were 39 shots in the game – and yet by the final quarter, Spurs seemed comfortable. United probably had the better of the first half-hour, although all they had to show for it was a series of headers over the bar from players who may or may not have been offside. In the minutes after going behind, Antony hit a post and Casemiro had a header athletically tipped over by Guglielmo Vicario. The game could have taken a different path. But it did not, and so the focus will be on United’s lack of coherence, on the weird lack of urgency from Raphaël Varane and Christian Eriksen in the buildup to Tottenham’s second, the lack of direction or drive in the final third of the game. And on the other side of the equation, Tottenham’s late swagger, the uncharacteristic ease with which they saw the game out, will dominate the thinking. It might not have been, but ultimately this was a glorious start for Angeball. It probably needed to be. There was an odd mood around Tottenham Hotspur Stadium before kick-off: the excitement and expectation of early season tempered by understandable frustration about the club’s owners, in particular the decision to recategorise a number of games so that, although the prices of season tickets have been frozen, the average cost of a ticket has risen. “To Dare Is Too Dear. ENIC out,” read one flag, adapting the club motto, while a Harry Kane chant was repurposed to “Exploiting your own.” Kane’s absence, of course, lurked unavoidably just below the surface. It probably wouldn’t have taken much for the mood to have turned. As it was, the noise as a trumpeter led a pre-kick off rendition of When the Spurs Go Marching In was undeniably rousing. There was also a baffling tifo in the South Stand as, in what Ange Postencoglou will hope is a metaphor, a series of disparate pieces slowly coalesced into a coherent whole, the message “Welcome to N17”. Which is surely not a phrase even the Haringey Tourist Board, if such a thing exists, has ever contemplated broadcasting before. Perhaps it was meant as a threat. United had been fortunate to beat Wolves on Monday, repeatedly being cut apart by Matheus Cunha’s drives through the centre. Erik ten Hag started with the same XI and they were far less open, probably largely because they were far less attacking. But once James Maddison, who ended up running the midfield, had sliced through a similar channel on the half-hour, United seemed to freeze and the United woodwork was struck twice before half-time, once by Pedro Porro and then in the follow-up as a Pape Sarr cutback cannoned off Luke Shaw. It was Sarr who put Spurs ahead four minutes into the second half, nobody picking up his 40-yard surge to get on the end of Dejan Kulusevki’s cross which, as with most consequential interventions in the game, deflected off Martínez. The expected United rally failed to materialise. Postecoglou must take credit for the way he closed down the left side, bringing on Ivan Perisic and Ben Davies, who eventually combined to provoke Martínez’s own goal. But this was also about United’s failings. Marcus Rashford never looks as convincing through the centre as he does on the left and Alejandro Garnacho never looks as convincing starting the game as he does as a substitute. The need for a centre-forward is obvious and, while Rasmus Højlund may be that figure, he is only 21. Anthony Martial did eventually come off the bench to little effect but, yet again, it’s hard not to wonder at what a weirdly lopsided squad United have. There are problems too in midfield. Mason Mount is a very fine player and ought to offer balance as the link between Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes but that combination is not working yet. Yves Bissouma, Sarr and Maddison ended up almost entirely dominant. Two games into the season and United’s only goal has been a header from a centre-back, while they have been carved open repeatedly. But what must be most concerning is the way United seemed to lose their zip and their belief. Ten Hag was keen to insist they had not collapsed and, while that might be true, neither were they especially resilient. To focus on that, though, is perhaps a little unfair on Tottenham and Postecoglou. Particularly after the grim football of the past couple of seasons, this was thrilling stuff and it brought an impressive win. The post-Kane era might not be so bad after all."
Liverpool,3,Bournemouth,1,Liverpool shrug off early setback and Mac Allister red to sink Bournemouth,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/liverpool-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-19,"A calamitous start; an accomplished finish. Liverpool’s first win of the new campaign followed the pattern of this week’s search for a defensive midfielder to perfection. Anfield was heartened and perplexed by Jürgen Klopp’s team in equal measure. Liverpool produced a vibrant comeback to defeat Bournemouth despite being reduced to 10 men and despite the defensive frailties that continue to accompany their prodigious attacking strength. Dominik Szoboszlai shone on his Anfield debut but fellow summer signing Alexis Mac Allister was harshly sent off on his first home start and will miss next Sunday’s visit to Newcastle unless Liverpool succeed in overturning referee Thomas Bramall’s decision. The club are considering an appeal. Goals from Luis Díaz, Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota delivered a deserved victory for Klopp’s team but this was a gruelling effort. New signing Wataru Endo was introduced “in horrible circumstances”, according to his manager, as Liverpool’s 10 men fought to contain Andoni Iraola’s relentless visitors. The hosts’ recovery was exemplary, but only necessary because of a dreadful start that could have led to them being two goals down and a man down inside nine minutes. “We had a wake-up call in the first minute but then two minutes later we concede again and two minutes after that our goalie is booked,” reflected Klopp. “We had to figure out why and then we were awake. Step by step we played really well.” Bournemouth were unrecognisable from the team humiliated 9-0 in Scott Parker’s final game as manager here 12 months ago and fully deserving of an early lead. The hosts started with only two new faces, Mac Allister and the gifted Szoboszlai, but the rapport of complete strangers. Miscommunication littered Liverpool’s first steps. Only 53 seconds had elapsed when Jaidon Anthony rolled the ball into an empty Kop goal after a mix-up between Trent Alexander-Arnold and Alisson. The visitors’ celebrations were curtailed by a close offside call against the goalscorer but Liverpool, and Alexander-Arnold in particular, failed to heed the warning. Less than two minutes later the Liverpool right-back was dispossessed by Philip Billing after receiving Virgil van Dijk’s pass in midfield. The destructive Billing released Dominic Solanke and, though Andy Robertson was able to block the former Liverpool forward’s shot, Antoine Semenyo lashed the loose ball beyond Alisson. The Liverpool goalkeeper produced another calamity when stumbling on a Van Dijk pass outside his area and playing in Anthony. Alisson tripped the winger as he advanced on goal and was only spared a possible ninth minute red card because of Ibrahima Konaté covering behind. In the 26th minute Anfield rose to applaud Michael Jones, the 26-year-old construction worker who died in an accident at Everton’s new stadium development at Bramley Moore dock on Monday. Klopp and the Liverpool first team squad had visited a memorial to the young Evertonian on their pre-match walk. The Liverpool manager left a wreath of flowers with a card that read: “Condolences from everyone at Liverpool Football Club. YNWA” before the group held a minute’s silence. A touch of class. The applause for Jones was still reverberating when Liverpool levelled. The home team’s performance improved immeasurably from that moment. Alexander-Arnold compensated for his defensive lapses, as he does so often, with a part in all three Liverpool goals. He picked out Diogo Jota with a fine ball from the right. The forward swept into the area and squared for Díaz to tee himself up for an acrobatic finish into the bottom corner. Szoboszlai won a penalty when making the most of contact from Joe Rothwell’s outstretched leg. “A soft, soft penalty,” said Iraola. Neto saved brilliantly from Salah’s spot-kick but was furious to see Bournemouth’s players stand and admire his efforts while Salah converted the rebound unchallenged. Liverpool were rampant at the start of the second half until Mac Allister received a straight red for a foul on Ryan Christie. The dismissal looked harsh, although the World Cup winner was late and high with a challenge that resulted in the Bournemouth midfielder’s own early exit. The 10 men made light of the dismissal. Szoboszlai collected Alexander-Arnold’s touch and drilled in a low shot that Neto parried into the path of Jota. The Portugal international made no mistake and though Bournemouth pressed, with Alisson saving smartly from substitutes Justin Kluivert and Hamed Traoré, Liverpool held on."
Wolves,1,Brighton,4,Brighton thrash sorry Wolves with second-half blitz led by Solly March,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/wolves-brighton-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-19,"Brighton just keeping getting better and better. Finishing sixth in the Premier League, while selling their best players, usually to Chelsea, does not seem to put any limit on their upward trajectory. Their fans were left singing “We are top of the league” as three goals inside the first 10 minutes of the second half enabled this free-flowing side to embellish their standing. Solly March scored two of these, following a close-range finish from Pervis Estupiñán and, in the first half, a memorable solo effort from Kaoru Mitoma. Since Roberto De Zerbi was appointed last October, only Manchester City and Liverpool can match the 69 goals Brighton have scored in their 34 Premier League games. Successive 4-1 victories have reassured them that selling Moisés Caicedo, Robert Sánchez, Alexis Mac Allister and Leandro Trossard need not impede their progress. After all, they recovered from the sales of Ben White and Marc Cucurella, their previous players of the year, to maintain their rise. Brighton have overtaken Wolves during this period and this was their fourth successive victory over a team that, having alleviated their sense of crisis with a stirring performance in losing to Manchester United on Monday, fell apart after an encouraging first half. Wolves have also sold some of their best players this summer but, on this evidence, are less well equipped to cope with their succession. To cap a bad day, Matheus Nunes was sent off in the fifth minute of added time for his second caution, foolishly shoving Aaron Webster and Estupiñán. At least Hwang Hee-chan claimed their first goal of the season and Gary O’Neil was encouraged this performance was “not worlds apart” from the display he orchestrated at Old Trafford on Monday. Since the start of last season, Wolves have the lowest shot-conversion rate in the Premier League. O’Neil wants the team to keep pressing high but, with the risk attached to that positive outlook, accepts his players need to start scoring. “It’s a two-game snapshot for me,” the Wolves manager said. “But to have 38 shots and an xG of four from two games is high.” The matching 4-4-2 formations and attacking mindsets led to a thrillingly open game awash with space and chances; it also meant taking opportunities was even more pivotal than usual. Brighton’s slick play has been well-honed and their one-touch football helped keep them one step ahead of Wolves; the other key difference was their ball-carrier-in-chief. Mitoma finished his finest run with a brilliant solo goal, cruising past three defenders before opening his body to score. Brighton have won their opening away game for the past five seasons; Wolves have failed to win their first home match in this their sixth successive season in the Premier League. If they are to consider rectifying that in 12 months’ time, O’Neil has his work cut out. This was their best lineup and they looked thin, in experience, in cover and depth. Wolves responded to Mitoma’s opener with a buccaneering half an hour and if Fábio Silva, Pedro Neto, Matheus or Rayan Aït-Nouri had scored when they were in on goal, with the home crowd on the front foot, this could have been a very different game. Instead, Brighton scored immediately in the second half. After a Wolves attack, Matheus did not track Estupiñán who scored from Mitoma’s pullback after Danny Welbeck’s shot was parried. Then Julio Enciso twice set up March to score from close range, the first with a gorgeous pass with the outside of a boot from the left, the second after good work by Welbeck. “Julio was one of the best players on the pitch, if not the best,” De Zerbi said."
Fulham,0,Brentford,3,Bryan Mbeumo double seals Brentford’s win at Fulham after Tim Ream’s red card,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/fulham-brentford-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-19,"A meeting of west London’s two best teams of last season, 10th hosting ninth. After a far stormier summer and in losing so slackly at home to Brentford, Fulham look in far greater danger of being unable to maintain previous standards. Where will their goals come from? On Saturday night the club confirmed that Aleksandar Mitrovic has joined the Saudi Arabian gold rush and will team up with Neymar at Al-Hilal. “He forced everything to leave the club, he wanted to leave the club,” said Marco Silva. Raúl Jiménez, Fulham’s summer arrival and Mitrovic’s putative replacement, has now gone 25 Premier League games without a goal. Silva, having turned down a Saudi opportunity himself, said he was “100% sure we are going to invest” in the closing days of the transfer market. “But the striker market is not easy.” The Riverside Stand, its central areas still empty as a lengthy building project drags on, is a towering reminder of high-premium jam tomorrow. For now, a lack of cutting edge and defending like Issa Diop’s for Yoane Wissa’s 44th-minute opener and Tim Ream’s clumsiness for a decisive, disputed penalty spell trouble. Brentford, continuing a proud record at Craven Cottage, having only lost twice there since 1981, look fully capable of pushing further onwards and upwards. “That’s us, that’s what we do, we make teams uncomfortable, our strikers work hard,” said their defender Nathan Collins. “We stayed strong; we kept our shape.” If a couple of wobbles from new goalkeeper Mark Flekken, David Raya having joined Arsenal this week, sounded a note of caution, Fulham could not pressure him nearly enough. In Ivan Toney’s absence, Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo have scored five Premier League goals in two matches. “I really enjoy it, I love to play in the middle,” said Wissa. “I spoke to Thomas [Frank] and he told me to press.” Frank said: “We were quite confident that Wissa and Mbeumo will provide us goals. So will [Keane] Lewis-Potter and [Kevin] Schade. That’s why we haven’t brought in another striker.” Flekken’s first flutter of uncertainty inspired Fulham to press and chase just as hard as their opponents, making for a fiercely fought first half of second balls and closed-off half-spaces. Creative juices were in short supply, though Mathias Jensen, spotting Bernd Leno way out on safari, narrowly missed from a free-kick just inside his opponent’s half. Brentford had located their momentum and it took Antonee Robinson’s last-ditch scrape of Wissa’s underpowered shot to stop Christian Nørgaard tapping home. Wissa was not to be denied when Diop made a mess of Kenny Tete’s back pass. The Congolese forward skated to the ball and slotted in. After the break, Jensen might have doubled the lead with a volley after Fulham’s Bobby De Cordova-Reid had faded a chip off the crossbar. The scrappiness continued, and Rico Henry was booked for time-wasting when he and Schade quarrelled over a throw-in. Fulham’s fate was sealed by Ream bundling into Wissa, the USA defender sent off for his second bookable offence. It looked soft, but Ream’s waving of a dismissive finger did little to change the mind of the referee, Darren Bond, or VAR. “The ref is always right, what can I say?” said an unapologetic Wissa. “From all 10 angles I cannot see anything there,” said Silva, before railing against the new season’s directives. “It’s the new Premier League, we have to get used to it. Any time you don’t have your hands in your pocket it’s a yellow card for the manager. Any time a player moves in the direction of the referee there will be a yellow card. We’ll have over 200 yellows in the first 10 weeks.” From the spot, Mbeumo showed Toney is not alone in sublime penalty technique. The Cameroon forward doubled his total by tapping in from Kristoffer Ajer’s assist during what were nine unnecessary minutes of time added on. Fulham were long since resigned to defeat."
Forest,2,Sheffield,1,Chris Wood gives Nottingham Forest late victory over Sheffield United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/18/chris-wood-gives-nottingham-forest-late-victory-over-sheffield-united,2023-08-18,"Last summer Nottingham Forest were widely derided for making 21 signings. And then, last September, Serge Aurier became No 22. Since avoiding relegation Forest have tried to strengthen again but Aurier was the unlikely catalyst behind Forest’s late victory over Sheffield United. He teed up Taiwo Awoniyi as Forest took the lead inside three minutes and another wicked delivery with a minute of normal time to spare supplied the substitute Chris Wood to head in a winner. It all felt rather cruel on Gustavo Hamer, the Blades midfielder whose debut goal was magnificent but ultimately, in brutal terms, had no bearing on this match. “It’s a great way to endear yourself to fans with a goal like that,” said the Sheffield United manager, Paul Heckingbottom, who remains desperate to add a striker to his squad after the sale of Iliman Ndiaye. Heckingbottom introduced two teenagers off the bench but his team struggled to make the most of their second-half dominance. “We’re doing the learning on the pitch in the Premier League,” he said. “We need firepower at the top end of the pitch so that there is more discomfort for whoever we’re playing against. There’s a commitment to get players in. But it’s tough recruiting. We’re not flush.” Before kick-off there was a rousing minute’s applause for former Forest players Trevor Francis and Chris Bart-Williams, both of whom died last month, and the thudding sound of the Forest faithful at full time as rain bucketed on to the pitch was something to savour. Aurier assisted two goals in a top-flight game for the second time in his career, the previous instance against the same opposition, for Spurs almost two and a half years ago. “Serge’s crossing all game was outstanding, it was something we talked about in the buildup, freeing up players in the box, and they were two brilliant headers from two brilliant crosses,” said Forest’s head coach, Steve Cooper. With two minutes and 23 seconds on the clock, Forest were in the driving seat. Brennan Johnson’s pace frightened United and he nudged the ball back for Aurier, whose first-time cross was inviting. Awoniyi got between Anel Ahmedhodzic and the United captain, John Egan, to head in from the edge of the six-yard box. There was a touch of Bebeto in the celebration as Awoniyi toasted the birth of his newborn son, Isaac. Dating back to last season, he has now scored in each of his past six league appearances. Matt Turner, Forest’s new No 1, punched the air. On 15 minutes Awoniyi surely would have converted another devilish cross from the right by Aurier, only for Ahmedhodzic to get a toe to the ball. Morgan Gibbs-White combined with Aurier on the same flank and the former Tottenham defender sent the ball into the box. Neco Williams arrived towards the back post but Ahmedhodzic again made a smart interception to sweep the ball clear. Vini Souza, a £12m summer signing from Lommel, at least tested Turner with a curling shot and Egan should have done better at a corner. United were a different animal after the interval. Ahmedhodzic forced Joe Worrall into a desperate block and Hamer’s equaliser was a thing of beauty. Scott McKenna’s clearance from a corner landed on the edge of the Forest box and from there Hamer, who tends to deal in the spectacular, trapped the ball and promptly caressed a graceful right-foot shot into the far corner. The away supporters behind the goal had the best seats in the house. Heckingbottom, who was booked at half-time, was calmness personified and merely clenched his right fist in celebration. Hamer’s goal galvanised United and Forest faded. Bénie Traoré, another summer signing, had United’s best chance to earn victory on 78 minutes. McKenna and Worrall went for the same ball and Traoré feasted on the leftovers. The Ivorian dribbled towards goal but his shot was too close to Turner. Wood had been on for only five minutes but seized his opportunity to make the difference. “This is a game now where it’s more than the starting XI, especially at the top end of the pitch because the game is so dynamic,” Cooper said. “They are 100-minute games now, minimum.”"
United,1,Wolves,0,Raphaël Varane gives nervy Manchester United win against lively Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/14/manchester-united-wolves-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-14,"Erik ten Hag’s tricky second album at Manchester United started with a victory but few will understand how. The hosts were dominated by a Wolves team that changed manager days before the start of the season and United were lucky not to concede a penalty in added time but still ended with the points. Wolves missed a collection of chances to at least get a point out of the match as Raphaël Varane’s header settled the result. Many will feel Wolves should have had a final chance to level matters in the dying seconds of the match when André Onana clattered into Sasa Kalajdzic, only for the referee, Simon Hooper, and his VAR colleagues to decide the challenge required no punishment, despite the goalkeeper getting nowhere near the ball. The new season was met with protests outside before kick-off as fans expressed their upset with the Glazer ownership of the club and they were joined by a separate manifestation regarding Mason Greenwood, while United debate whether to bring him back into the fold. They have delayed an announcement of his potential return after an internal investigation into the forward. Inside the ground there were banners and loud chants of “We want the Glazers out,” as frustration that the potential sale of United drags on. Onana’s debut was far more memorable than Mason Mount’s, with the former Chelsea midfielder, like his new teammates, unable to affect proceedings in the final third. He was selected alongside the captain, Bruno Fernandes, to play ahead of Casemiro but the newly configured midfield spent most of the evening watching Matheus Cunha cut through the heart of them. The Brazilian showed why Julen Lopetegui was so keen for Wolves to spend heavily on him but the departed Spaniard did not get as much out of him in five months as his replacement, Gary O’Neil, did in 77 minutes at Old Trafford. Unfortunately for Wolves, they were unable to find a vital goal, showing evidence of why they scored only 31 times last season. O’Neil has got the players well drilled already, bringing a new identity to the team, something that got the fans chanting his name from early on. It is harsh to criticise Cunha considering how much effort and dynamism he brought to Wolves but he will be frustrated he was unable to beat Onana. He was not the only culprit for the visitors, with Pedro Neto and substitute Fábio Silva having good chances without success. The visitors had 23 shots, the most from an away team in the league at Old Trafford since 2015, but only six on target, although the performance will give them hope that things are not as bad as it seemed when Lopetegui walked away last week. United were flat throughout, relying on two defenders to combine for the winner as their attackers struggled to create much in the final third. After 76 minutes of misplaced passes and quarter chances, Aaron Wan-Bissaka latched on to a sublime Bruno Fernandes pass, before lifting the ball to Varane to head home from close range. Many would have thought the goal would have lifted United and knocked Wolves’ confidence but instead the hosts retreated further into their shell as Wolves continued their dominant performance, forcing Onana into a number of saves and defenders into last-ditch blocks. Last campaign United lost their two opening games and they will be relieved supporters left Old Trafford with vague smiles on their faces, although many questions remain about how the side build on Ten Hag’s first season improvements. New signing Rasmus Højlund was unavailable because of a back problem, not that the presence of a striker is much use when a side is unable to create chances. They had three shots on target as José Sá was allowed a quiet night. Wolves cut through United with ease on a regular basis, Casemiro unable to hold back Cunha who showed incredible stamina and dribbling skills to take the ball up the pitch. Lisandro Martínez was taken off at the break after picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Neto, an example of United’s struggles against a club in flux. United will not be too bothered how the win came but they should have left with a point at best. Onana had a solid game in his first United appearance but should have ended it by facing a penalty when he jumped to catch a cross and caught Kalajdzic in the face without the ball in sight. Hooper did not immediately award the spot-kick but there was a hush inside the stadium as VAR reviewed it, only to determine there was not sufficient evidence to overturn the original decision. Wolves think otherwise, although United will be happy to let their complaints fall on deaf ears because their season is up and running, even if it was completely undeserved."
Chelsea,1,Liverpool,1,New-look Chelsea and Liverpool share spoils after Disasi equaliser for Blues,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/13/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-13,"After a nervous start to Mauricio Pochettino’s introduction to life at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea ended it looking fitter and more coherent than an inconsistent Liverpool. The positives outweighed the negatives for Pochettino, even if he still has to address familiar failings in attack, and once the dust settled it was hard not to feel that the bigger concerns belonged to Jürgen Klopp. Beyond Mohamed Salah’s angry reaction to being taken off after an ineffective second-half display, what really hit home was how quickly Liverpool fizzled out after dominating the first 25 minutes. The system unravelled and, while Trent Alexander-Arnold and Alexis Mac Allister caught the eye with their passing from deep, it was easy to see why Klopp wants Moisés Caicedo so badly. Liverpool still lack stability in midfield, threatening their hopes of a title challenge, and there is no doubt that Caicedo would make them a far more rounded outfit. Unfortunately for Klopp, of course, the expectation is that the Brighton midfielder will join Chelsea for £115m. They are set to break the British transfer record for the second time in six months, which perhaps explains why Pochettino keeps talking about needing to win now, and Caicedo will probably be an excellent partner for Enzo Fernández in midfield. Fernández impressed as this game wore on, offering the kind of classy touches that ought to come naturally to £106.8m midfielders, though he was helped by a wholehearted display from Conor Gallagher. Chelsea, who could also beat Liverpool to Southampton’s Roméo Lavia, lacked that commitment last season. This is a fresh start, although their failure to open their campaign with a win was broadly down to their lack of ruthlessness in the final third. Christopher Nkunku was missed after having knee surgery and while Chelsea responded well to Luis Díaz’s opener, levelling through Axel Disasi’s debut goal, the fact remains that Pochettino could do with adding more firepower to his squad. Nicolas Jackson and Mykhailo Mudryk spurning chances built the case for another striker to come in before the transfer window shuts. By the same token it must be pointed out that Jackson appears to have the tools to succeed in the Premier League. The former Villarreal striker was a handful throughout, his touch and mobility repeatedly troubling Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté, while Pochettino will also take encouragement from how many problems Raheem Sterling gave Andy Robertson. Sterling’s combinations with Chelsea’s new captain, Reece James, were a constant feature and Ben Chilwell also impressed at left wing. Equally, though, it was not as if Liverpool were constantly outplayed. They were quick to impose themselves, Cody Gakpo breaking through the lines and Salah curling against the bar in the 12th minute, and the high press functioned well at first. Dominik Szoboszlai worked hard to retrieve possession on his debut and Klopp’s decision to continue with Alexander-Arnold as an auxiliary midfielder was highly effective when the visitors had the ball. Having spent pre-season experimenting with his new squad, there was a new ploy from Pochettino. What looked like a back three on paper turned out to be a back four, with James at right-back, Disasi and Thiago Silva in the centre and Levi Colwill making his debut at left-back, and Chelsea needed a while to settle. They had four debutants on the pitch after a summer that has so far seen 12 players leave and it was worth remembering that he is doing so at a club who remain without a shirt sponsor. But Liverpool are also rebuilding. With Jordan Henderson, Naby Keïta, James Milner, Fabinho and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gone, Gakpo and Szoboszlai pushed high and the use of Mac Allister at the base of midfield had mixed results. Mac Allister was a No 6 wearing the No 10 shirt. The former Brighton midfielder demanded the ball on his debut, pleasing Klopp, and was involved when Liverpool went ahead in the 18th minute. The move began with Alisson playing out from the back and the danger increased when Mac Allister sprayed a piercing ball to Salah. Free to run at Colwill, Salah pushed the youngster back and carved Chelsea apart with a curving ball for Díaz to run off Disasi and beat Robert Sánchez. Chelsea probably would have collapsed last season. Wesley Fofana is out for the season and Sánchez, a £25m summer signing from Brighton, was not expected to be in goal before Real Madrid decided to sign Kepa Arrizabalaga on loan. Pochettino demands steel, though. Chelsea benefited from some fortune, not least when Liverpool were prevented from going 2-0 up when Salah was judged offside after being released by Alexander-Arnold and firing home. Yet Disasi was strong and Jackson was tenacious. Chelsea stirred, Sterling wriggling through on the right and winning a corner. Liverpool could not clear their lines and they cracked under sustained aerial pressure, Chilwell guiding a header back into the area and Disasi punishing sleepy defending from Alexander-Arnold by poking the loose ball beyond Alisson. Liverpool’s frailties grew. Alexander-Arnold’s defensive deficiencies were exposed when Fernández released Chilwell, who was denied a goal by a tight offside call. Short of protection, Mac Allister began to struggle. Liverpool became frayed and, as their creative threat dimmed, there was the spectacle of Salah chucking his wristbands to the turf after being withdrawn. Darwin Núñez threatened after coming off the bench, but Chelsea finished well. Chilwell, Jackson and Mudryk all went close, pleasing Pochettino. He will be even more optimistic once Caicedo arrives."
Brentford,2,Spurs,2,Emerson Royal earns Postecoglou opening draw for Spurs at Brentford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/13/brentford-tottenham-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-13,"After Harry? James Maddison wearing Harry Kane’s No 10 shirt presented a pointed kiss-off to Tottenham’s one‑of‑their-own all‑time top goalscorer last seen enduring defeat in the German Supercup. Ivan Toney’s absence until January, meanwhile, leaves Brentford’s forward line in the more than capable hands of Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo – tricky, zesty and both goalscorers amid Spurs’ reversion to a back four under Ange Postecoglou. Destiny Udogie at left-back and Micky van de Ven partnering Cristian Romero ahead of the new goalkeeper, Guglielmo Vicario, added further unfamiliarity. “We took a bit of a gamble throwing them in, they handled the pressure really well,” Postecoglou said. “Micky had only had three sessions with us but he’s going to be a very good player.” With David Raya Arsenal-bound, Mark Flekken, Brentford’s Dutch keeper, was also making a Premier League debut but Thomas Frank’s selection was far more recognisable than Postecoglou’s. As was Brentford’s style of play compared to the remodelled Tottenham, work with considerable progress to make but showing signs of traditional Spurs values as opposed to the doggerel of Antonio Conte, over an eventual 105 minutes. “Football clubs move on pretty quickly,” Postecoglou said. “I haven’t needed to give them a warm fuzzy cuddle.” Richarlison stepped from Kane’s shadow as the lone striker, Maddison’s shirt number suggesting him as a creator in the Hoddle/Sheringham mould. Central but drifting, Maddison had the stage his talents have long deserved and he was his team’s best performer. His dead-ball proficiency has never been in question and a cross from the left‑hand corner of Brentford’s box supplied the first goal of the Postecoglou era, Romero and Richarlison queueing to score. The Argentina international got there first but on‑field celebrations were delayed by a lengthy VAR review and Romero leaving the field with a concussion sustained during a previous collision with Mbeumo. On came Davinson Sánchez, a pariah last season but with rave pre‑season reviews. One of Postecoglou’s tasks is to polish the faded jewels he inherited, Yves Bissouma, showing flashes of his Brighton self in midfield, being another. “Bissouma has been outstanding through pre-season and was superb today,” Postecoglou said. A delayed kick-off, blamed on “sanitation issues”, briefly threatened the game taking place at all, the stadium’s toilets flush out of water until an emergency plumber answered the call. When the start eventually came, Brentford swarmed at Spurs, Wissa and Mbeumo soon hounding Vicario’s one-touch passing skills. After that storm abated, Tottenham played concerted minutes of creative, passing football promised by the new manager and scored their opener, only for Brentford to go again. The unfortunate Son Heung-min, the new club captain, was caught by VAR’s all-seeing eye, his slight trip on Mathias Jensen punished before Mbeumo sent Vicario the wrong way with his penalty. Vicario was left equally helpless by Brentford’s second. Rico Henry blazed past an idling Emerson Royal and cut back for Wissa’s shot to rattle off Van de Ven’s trailing leg. Emerson, within the 11 minutes added on to the first 45, made swift amends, the ball breaking from Maddison for him to lash home, uncharacteristically but spectacularly. The PA announcement of those 11 minutes had seemed to take the wind from Brentford’s sails; such added football asks different questions, Frank said later. Still, Henry, again leaving Emerson for dead, supplied Mbeumo with a golden chance he shanked over in the half’s closing seconds. The second half brought change and a Spurs improvement. Brentford’s main creative outlet remained their hard press. Frank, typically positive about his team, expressed disappointment they had not won. “I thought we definitely created more chances,” he said. “In a relatively tight game I think we should have won it. We kept them to little with a low block. The two goals were the smallest chances that they had.” Richarlison’s first-half lack of movement, chastised by Son at one point, had been unhelpful to Spurs though he began the half looking more interested, perhaps after receiving some Melburnian invective. Maddison’s angled pass gave the Brazilian his best chance to shoot but Flekken had narrowed the angles. “We didn’t use him enough,” Richarlison’s new manager suggested. As 90 minutes closed out, two very different sides had nullified each other. Vicario’s wobbles continued with a couple of scares, before just four minutes of injury time was called. Spurs closed out passing the ball while unable to find a goal, settling for the same scoreline as last season, when Kane was still around to save them. “We wanted to go out and give our supporters some hope and belief in the team,” Postecoglou said. “I thought they did that today.”"
Newcastle,5,Villa,1,Sandro Tonali and Alexander Isak star in Newcastle’s rout of Aston Villa,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/12/newcastle-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-12,"The fly-on-the-wall documentary We are Newcastle United showing on Prime Video every Friday night may be safe and sanitised but the real thing is anything but. Unvarnished, unspun and viewed with the naked eye, Newcastle are brilliant and brutal, ruthless and relentless. In cameos, Aston Villa reminded everyone they remain a decent team but Unai Emery’s players could not match the edge and desire of the hosts, who have found a new cult hero in Italy’s Sandro Tonali. Indeed as an increasingly forlorn Villa manager surveyed the defensive carnage unfolding in front of him you wondered if he regretted rejecting the Newcastle job subsequently accepted by Eddie Howe in November 2021. Since then an amalgam of Howe’s coaching and Saudi Arabian money has created a squad that looks eminently capable of gracing this season’s Champions League. Not to mention fuelling Tyneside optimism. Sure enough, after only seven minutes St James’ Park reverberated to triumphalist choruses of “We’re going to win the league”. Sixty seconds earlier Tonali finished off a move he had started courtesy of a fine central midfield interception and Newcastle were ahead. After stretching to connect with a fine left wing cross dispatched by the outstanding Anthony Gordon, Howe’s £50m summer signing from Milan volleyed the ball inexorably beyond Emiliano Martínez. At that point Newcastle’s high-energy press appeared powered by high voltage electricity, leaving Emery appealing for calm from his panicked charges. Villa needed to regroup but, happily for the Spaniard, France’s Moussa Diaby was on hand to help. By way of celebrating his summer move from Bayer Leverkusen, Diaby duly volleyed an invitingly bouncing ball beyond Nick Pope after being left unattended 12 yards out. Once again, that goal came from a cross, in this instance flicked on by Ollie Watkins. Newcastle swiftly regained their lead. Once more Tonali assumed a central role, collecting Kieran Trippier’s short free-kick and lifting it into the area for Sven Botman to hook square for Alexander Isak to prod past Argentina’s goalkeeper. With Tonali, Bruno Guimarães and Joelinton – who played a lovely one-two with Gordon in the preamble to Tonali’s opener – showing every indication of proving a formidable midfield trio Howe’s team often seemed irresistible. “Sandro was magnificent,” said Newcastle’s manager, whose side travel to Manchester City for an intriguing engagement on Saturday. “It was a tight, tough game decided by our ruthlessness and we can improve. But we want our supporters to dream.” Villa, too, harbour ambitions of impressing in elite circles and when Diaby and Watkins joined forces they sometimes succeeded in emphasising that Botman and his defensive colleagues are mortal after all. Emery could have done without losing his own central defensive linchpin when Tyrone Mings was carried off with a serious knee injury, potentially a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament, in the 30th minute after a routine challenge with Isak. “The result is bad but losing Tyrone was worse,” said Emery. “It doesn’t look good. It’s very sad for him and for us.” On came another Villa debutant in Pau Torres. The Spain defender, previously part of Emery’s Villarreal backline, displayed some classy touches but could have wished for a less stressful introduction. Martínez certainly looked fazed as he hared way out of his area only to be beaten to the ball by Miguel Almirón before hauling the Paraguayan back. Along with the majority of the crowd, Howe demanded a red card but the referee merely issued a yellow one. It seemed that he had, correctly, determined that, with a trio of Villa shirts blocking Almirón’s already lengthy route to goal, it was far from a clear-cut scoring opportunity. No matter; as Tonali, all sharp, elegant, intelligent, movement, continued enthralling his new public, Isak grew in attacking stature. The Sweden forward scored again after Ezri Konsa lost concentration and made an awful hash of subduing an admittedly sublime Gordon pass. All that remained was for Isak to intervene, pinch possession and dink the ball over the advancing Martínez. Even the subsequently joint withdrawal of Isak and Gordon did Villa little good. Their replacements, Callum Wilson and Harvey Barnes, promptly combined, with the latter squaring for Wilson to score Newcastle’s fourth. Not to be outdone, Barnes then accelerated through Villa’s slapdash and shattered defence to become the evening’s third scoring debutant. “Newcastle’s power was very big,” said Emery. “They were good.”"
Everton,0,Fulham,1,Bobby De Cordova-Reid gets Fulham off to winning start at wasteful Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/12/everton-fulham-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-12,"How many warnings do the Everton hierarchy need? Two consecutive brushes with relegation are not enough, it would appear. The opening day of what is scheduled to be the final full season of Goodison Park’s existence produced yet another warning as Everton dominated Fulham only to succumb to an avoidable, unnecessary defeat. They lost not simply as a consequence of three Fulham substitutes – Aleksandar Mitrovic, Andreas Pereira and goalscorer Bobby De Cordova-Reid – combining to polish an otherwise subdued display from the visitors. They lost because for the third summer in succession the club has failed to strengthen its forward line as required. A third successive season of struggle beckons unless that glaring weakness is addressed before the transfer deadline. Fulham had nine shots in total, two on target, compared with 19 efforts and nine on target from Everton. Only the visitors had a clinical edge worthy of the highest level, however, to leave Sean Dyche understandably aghast at a performance of promise finishing pointless. “We played well, a lot of the things we are looking for were there, but we have to score a goal,” he said. “We had one of the highest chance counts in my time here and five of them were high-quality.” You may have read the following before. Many times. Dominic Calvert-Lewin was deemed not fit enough for the match-day squad and so, given Everton’s inability to sign a proven alternative, Dyche had little option but to start Neal Maupay as a lone forward. Maupay, who scored once last season, had enough chances to put Everton out of sight before half-time but was unable to take one. Bernd Leno proved a formidable obstacle in the Fulham goal but there was a lack of conviction and quality to Maupay’s finishing that was all too familiar to an exasperated home support. It was last season’s attacking lowlights reel on repeat. The former Brighton forward shot narrowly wide after 35 seconds. He was presented with a gilt-edged opportunity when Abdoulaye Doucouré headed an Alex Iwobi centre to his feet. Unmarked and four yards out, Maupay prodded a weak touch straight at Leno. The striker found himself one-on-one with Leno again when Amadou Onana, Everton’s most creative outlet, dissected the defence with a perfect first-time pass. Fulham’s keeper saved comfortably again. Leno also denied Doucouré with an outstretched boot when a sweeping Everton move released last season’s relegation saviour through on goal. Iwobi and Nathan Patterson also missed decent chances before the break and Michael Keane had a goal disallowed after Leno dropped a cross at his feet. The referee, Stuart Attwell, penalised James Tarkowski for a foul on the commanding keeper. “I don’t know why VAR didn’t get involved,” said Dyche. “Tarky does nothing, minimal contact other than the keeper landing on him. He didn’t do anything to put the keeper off and he drops it.” Dyche can take consolation from the improvement in Everton’s energy, creativity and organisation, while despairing at the end product. His team’s woeful afternoon in front of goal was encapsulated by Patterson hitting the crossbar from eight yards out after Leno’s fingertip save from Iwobi left him facing an open net. Fulham were tame and timid in comparison, particularly in the first half, although improved by their second-half substitutes. Raúl Jiménez was unlucky not to score on his Fulham debut when hooking Harry Wilson’s cross on to the base of a post. The visitors carved open Everton again when Pereira swept Mitrovic’s threaded pass across the face of Jordan Pickford’s goal for De Cordova-Reid to convert at the back post. “It was not a good performance,” said Marco Silva. “It is not a problem for me to say Everton deserved better but it’s a great feeling when you don’t play at your level for 95 minutes and you are able to win away from home.”"
Sheffield,0,Palace,1,Édouard enables Crystal Palace to rise above Sheffield United and Guaita row,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/12/sheffield-united-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-12,"At 76, Roy Hodgson has been around the football block a few times but hearing how goalkeeper Vicente Guaita had answered the tweet from Crystal Palace account’s listing Saturday’s XI, half an hour before kick-off, with “where is my name?” was a new one on him. Guaita is out of favour after refusing to play in pre-season so who he was blaming is a puzzle. And, given how rarely Sam Johnstone was troubled, Guaita missed an easy outing, as this contest was decided by an Odsonne Édouard strike. He stuck a boot out to poke past Wes Foderingham, Sheffield United’s goalkeeper, after Jordan Ayew dropped a shoulder to gain a yard on Ben Osborn before whipping over a classic slicing cross from the right. Asked about Guaita’s tweet, Hodgson said: “I didn’t know that happened – I’m glad we got through today, our keeper was largely untroubled. That type of thing would be something that he and the club would have to sort out. For me that doesn’t have any effect.” Hodgson also had a 63rd-minute coming together with Sheffield United’s Max Lowe, after the player pushed his stomach when going for the ball, the pair momentarily grappling. “I suppose I don’t take many challenges these days at my age, so it took me by surprise,” said Hodgson. “It was nothing and immediately afterwards Max Lowe looked over and we smiled. He realised he hadn’t done a lot to hurt me and I was probably surprised I’ve got the energy to react the way I did.” In blazing sunshine the home side returned to the Premier League promising they will “not build the narrative” around being underdogs in 2023-24. Yet in mentioning it in his programme notes, Paul Heckingbottom did precisely this. Why he cares is a puzzle, as harnessing a them-against-us mentality may be the club’s best hope of survival. Heckingbottom’s analysis of this reverse correctly surmised that United were not embarrassed but Palace did breach Foderingham’s goal twice more, even if the efforts of Ayew (in the first half) and Édouard (after his winner) were flagged offside. He said: “I can’t be critical but I think we needed the first goal – by being disruptive, aggressive, we made an impact.” Manager’s programme notes should not be a hotbed of news but another Heckingbottom sentence caught the eye, as he wrote: “It would be remiss if I did not mention our biggest concern, losing very influential players as we have.” Referring to the loss of Sander Berge (to Burnley) and Iliman Ndiaye (to Marseille) did not read as a vote of confidence for the side he sent out for this return to the big time after two seasons in the Championship. “There’s certainty 1 or 2 we want in – hopefully before the next game,” he said. Will Osula, a 20-year-old with seven league substitute appearances, was the effective replacement for Ndiaye, operating as the lone forward. His was the first shot that beat Johnstone, though not the keeper’s right post. For Palace, Eberechi Eze drove at the home rearguard and had an effort blocked, as the visitors sought to kickstart a new era, which might be called “life after Wilfried Zaha”, after the 30-year-old’s move to Galatasaray. Hodgson, who may lose the injured Michael Olise (Chelsea are interested) used a 4-2-3-1 that cancelled out the hosts’ 5-4-1 and the first half was the stalemate that may be expected from sides whose first instinct is to retain top-flight status. Palace dominated after the interval, meaning a flash of quality for the home side was needed to draw level. Bénie Traoré had the chance to illustrate he could provide it but his pass went to absolutely no one and so with 10 minutes left Heckingbottom made a triple change – Traoré lucky to remain involved – but this did not work. Gustavo Hamer, for £15m, has come in as Berge’s replacement but this evidence suggests Heckingbottom will have to be a transfer-market magician to acquire the stardust needed to avoid each match day being the latest instalment in an unwanted underdog narrative."
Brighton,4,Luton,1,João Pedro and Ferguson ease Brighton to opening win over promoted Luton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/12/brighton-luton-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-12,"Whatever happens, it is going to be a season to savour for Luton supporters. A decade after their side kicked off their fourth season in a row in the depths of the National League, only a late Brighton onslaught after João Pedro’s contentious penalty broke the resolve of the Premier League new boys. While Brighton fully deserved their victory in a week they were forced to deal with the distraction of Moisés Caicedo’s future, this was at no point an easy ride. Luton defended valiantly throughout and even looked like they might snatch something when Carlton Morris slotted home their first Premier League goal from the penalty spot with 10 minutes to play. But it was the substitute Simon Adingra who settled this after a mistake from Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu before Evan Ferguson rounded things off with a late fourth. “We were right in the game but we shot ourselves in the foot,” said Luton’s manager, Rob Edwards. “At this level you get punished and that shows the ruthless nature of the league. The players said we showed we belong at this level but they have to learn quickly.” The size of Luton’s task after they returned to the top flight for the first time in 31 years was underlined by the fact that Roberto De Zerbi was able to select a team boasting more than 1,600 Premier League appearances – albeit 620 to a 37-year-old called James Milner – while his counterpart could rely on 63 as he handed five summer signings their debuts. With Alexis Mac Allister departed and Caicedo expected to follow him, De Zerbi turned to the Germany international Mahmoud Dahoud to fill the void and deployed Milner at right-back. They and João Pedro, the £30m club record signing from Watford, made a strong impression on their debuts but the Brighton manager was particularly delighted with the Ivory Coast forward Adingra – who spent last season on loan at Union SG, Brighton’s sister club in Belgium – after the 21-year-old’s decisive goal seven minutes after coming off the bench with Ferguson. “He can play with the same quality on the left or the right,” said De Zerbi. “But we have a lot of attacking options this season.” Much to the delight of the away supporters behind the goal who barracked him all afternoon, João Pedro wasted a golden opportunity to give Brighton the lead inside five minutes when his shot somehow skewed off target. Despite dominating possession, they had to wait until 10 minutes before half-time for the breakthrough and it came from a familiar source as Solly March nodded home Kaoru Mitoma’s perfect cross to the back post. Brighton were relieved to scramble the ball away following a corner after Jason Steele had saved from Morris. Danny Welbeck then stuck a post as the half ended in frenetic fashion, with a yellow card shown to Mitoma for kicking the ball away. Brighton came within inches of stretching their lead straight after the restart when Thomas Kaminski pushed Milner’s close-range shot on to the post. It took another strong save to deny March his second after a flowing move and he was unlucky not to save João Pedro’s penalty after the Brazilian went down very easily under a challenge from Tom Lockyer that was surprisingly not overturned by VAR. David Coote opted to award a penalty at the other end with 10 minutes to play, this time for a handball against Lewis Dunk when it seemed to have struck his trailing arm. Morris stroked home from the spot before Adingra pounced on Mpanzu’s error inside his own penalty area and Ferguson tapped home Pervis Estupiñán’s cross to seal the points for Brighton."
Bournemouth,1,West Ham,1,Solanke strikes to save point for Bournemouth against West Ham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/12/bournemouth-west-ham-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-12,"Just as it seemed West Ham and Jarrod Bowen would carry on where they left off in last season’s Europa Conference League final, Bournemouth equalised through Dominic Solanke to earn Andoni Iraola a point in his first match in charge. David Moyes looked miffed with a draw at full-time and stood with his arms folded on the edge of his technical area when Solanke rounded Alphonse Areola with 82 minutes on the clock. Iraola, in a black turtleneck jumper, high-fived his players as they headed down the tunnel. Long before that history-making night in Prague West Ham swallowed the reality of losing Declan Rice to a bigger fish but did not countenance the prospect of selling Lucas Paquetá a month later. West Ham rejected an opening £70m proposal from Manchester City for Paquetá this week butgiven the Brazil midfielder is keen to make the move and has an £85m release clause that kicks in next summer, it feels almost inevitable his future will soon lie elsewhere. Moyes acknowledged his two prized assets departing within weeks of each other would be a blow but refused to sugarcoat the situation. “I’ve got to make sure I keep a good harmony in the squad, in the club and that things are done correctly,” he said. “It is maybe a different circumstance with Harry Kane but there is a price on everybody’s head somewhere. We wouldn’t want Lucas to go, it’s as simple as that, but I also understand if you were in Lucas’s position sometimes it is quite difficult to say: ‘Sorry, you can’t join Manchester City or Real Madrid’, because they are two of the biggest clubs in the world.When you’re on a journey, it’s hard to lose your best players.” Paquetá impressed and rattled the post on 84 minutes, moments after Solanke pulled Bournemouth level after latching on to a miscued shot by Antoine Semenyo that arrived at his feet via Tomas Soucek’s heel. Paquetá then freed Danny Ings but Chris Mepham diverted his shot wide. Early in the second half, Paquetá’s volley from an Emerson Palmieri cutback was headed clear and he was the architect behind much of West Ham’s craft. Before the interval, the Brazilian went to ground inside the West Ham area to scoop the ball away from the Bournemouth midfielder Ryan Christie and then expertly shielded the ball while on his backside. The goal in front of the Steve Fletcher Stand had plenty of action. Soucek toe-poked against a post early in the first half after being slipped in by Saïd Benrahma, only for the ball to shoot straight into the gloves of a grateful Neto in the Bournemouth goal. Philip Billing wellied the ball clear on the goalline after Michail Antonio latched on to a Paquetá flick at a corner. Joe Rothwell located the crossbar midway through the second half with a curling strike after cutting inside Pablo Fornals and David Brooks also went close, his stinging left-foot volley from the edge of the 18-yard box prompting Areola to tip the ball over. Six minutes into the second half Bowen set off on a now-familiar knee slide in front of the travelling West Ham supporters. Fornals slid in to halt the advancing Rothwell 30 yards from the Bournemouth goal and Soucek nudged the ball into Bowen. Bowen quickly shifted the ball out of his feet and sent a delightful left-foot strike arrowing into the top corner. “Champions of Europe, you know what we are,” crowed the away fans. “I was quite critical of the team at half-time because we were moving the ball too slow,” Iraola said. “We improved in the second half, but not as much as we would like.”"
Arsenal,2,Forest,1,Saka stunner seals Arsenal victory despite late Nottingham Forest rally,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/12/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-12,"One of Arsenal’s revamped systems failed but another just about held up. If this season is to be a sinew-straining exercise in keeping pace with Manchester City then they got the first step more or less right, although a late wobble from nowhere was a reminder nothing will come easy. The home crowd, many of whom were stuck outside before the game due to problems at the turnstiles that delayed kick-off by half an hour, could breathe easily and reflect that their team had played enough of the hits to breed optimism. Bukayo Saka belted one out resoundingly and ensured Nottingham Forest, seemingly well beaten before a last-gasp flurry, faced too long a route back. Arsenal had overcome a slow start to lead through Eddie Nketiah’s deflected shot when, six minutes later, William Saliba won possession in Forest’s left-back position. The ball was worked to Saka, who shrugged off Orel Mangala and bent in a vicious curler that Matt Turner had no chance of repelling. Saka looked jaded at the end of 2022-23, and was far from the only one, but this was Arsenal’s star attraction at his most compelling. “An incredible finish,” said Mikel Arteta, although he was even more effusive about its more fortunate predecessor. Nketiah had been widely expected to deputise for the injured Gabriel Jesus in last Sunday’s Community Shield and was stung when Kai Havertz was selected up front instead. Arsenal were hogging the ball but failing to make many inroads when Gabriel Martinelli, if by accident more than design, pirouetted on the left side of the penalty area and backheeled to Nketiah in space. A drilled finish gave Turner, who had left Arsenal for Forest only three days previously, no chance and earned the scorer lavish plaudits. “He is a role model,” Arteta said. “He was so disappointed not to play in the absence of Gabi. He came in the final and changed the game, that’s No 1. The second thing was the way he trained this week, saying: ‘Gaffer, if you’re not playing me you’re blind.’ He’s a clear example to everybody.” Arteta had, as he admitted, set a precedent for the season by switching up his team. Gabriel Magalhães was moved to the bench, meaning Ben White tucked in at centre-back and Havertz adopted the attacking midfield role for which he has been signed. Thomas Partey’s movements infield from right-back meant that, for long periods, their formation was akin to 3-1-3-3. It was Saliba’s failure to cut out a regulation header forward from Willy Boly, rather than any wider malfunction, that let Brennan Johnson in for a clear opportunity in the 11th minute. The Forest forward should have tested Aaron Ramsdale at the barest minimum; instead he sidefooted high and wide and it did not take a sage to understand the visitors would rarely happen upon such an appetising chance. Soon enough they were all but out of the game, primarily kept in it by Arsenal’s inability to turn the screw. The first cloud on their afternoon came with an injury to Jurriën Timber, who had made a composed competitive debut at left-back but felt the effects of a first-half knock and pulled up five minutes after the interval. Thereafter, proceedings took on a pre-season hue with surprising ease, Forest going through the motions of mustering extra threat on the rare occasions they were given an extended feel of the ball. Declan Rice, a commanding presence if not always at his crispest, forced Turner to tip a deflected strike on to his left post and parry away a curious bobbled effort. But Arsenal were nowhere near full tilt and almost immediately after the latter allowed Forest to break from a corner. The recently introduced substitute Anthony Elanga was able to carry the ball 70 yards up the left flank unopposed and centre for another replacement, Taiwo Awoniyi, to score emphatically. The Emirates, snoozy since Saka’s blast, woke up and was almost aghast when Morgan Gibbs-White fired over. Perhaps seven minutes of added time felt relatively small beer given the fans’ earlier wait to enter the ground. Arsenal saw it out and Arteta praised the manner in which they did so, although he urged them to be “more ruthless and more critical of ourselves to be pushy and kill the game”. His opposite number, Steve Cooper, was left to rue the mountain Forest had to climb. “I’m frustrated with the first half,” he said. “At half-time, we questioned ourselves in terms of competing. In the second half we showed a bit more quality and belief that we belong at this level. It then leaves a feeling of what might have been.” Arsenal can sympathise with that sensation but will feel fully entitled to dream once more."
Burnley,0,City,3,Erling Haaland launches Manchester City to opening victory at Burnley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/11/burnley-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report,2023-08-11,"This was billed as a box-office Premier League curtain raiser and did not disappoint. Manchester City arrived at Turf Moor as the champions of the past three seasons and left suggesting Pep Guardiola could well drive them to a record fourth consecutive crown. Burnley, promoted as Championship winners, can be proud of giving City a contest and Vincent Kompany, who proved himself a serious managerial talent last season, will have learned much about his team. In claiming the second tier competition by 20 points in a first English campaign, the Belgian attracted Tottenham’s interest, as Antonio Conte’s replacement, and suggested he may follow Guardiola one day into the hot seat at City, the side he captained with distinction for many of his 11 years playing there. Four of those were under Guardiola which added an intriguing sub-plot to this battle, though Kompany and the 52-year-old locked horns last season, when those in blue gave those in claret a 6-0 schooling in the FA Cup. Yet while the margin was narrower here, the treble-winners are firmly up and running. City were ruthless. Kevin De Bruyne poked over a first corner from the right and the ball broke back to the Belgian, who chipped it to the far post where Rodri headed to Erling Haaland, whose finish came after four minutes. “We’re champions of Europe, we know what we are,” sang delirious City fans, and already Burnley might have been in damage-limitation mode. But in front of a raucous home support, Kompany’s men pressed and Zeki Amdouni went over with Manuel Akanji challenging but Craig Pawson, the referee, was not interested. Guardiola spoke of his players being at the “bottom of the mountain” again but their beginning suggested a hunger to remount it. De Bruyne is City’s barometer – if the playmaker is pulling strings as he can, then this formidable side are in sync, and his next showing was a curled left-foot delivery from which Haaland attempted a bicycle kick. It missed, just as Luca Koleosho did when Burnley worked the ball expertly to the winger, who should have made Ederson save rather than plonking his effort over. Amdouni did manage to work the goalkeeper after leaving Nathan Aké trailing, forcing the Ederson to crouch low to gather. Guardiola had given his new centre-back, Josko Gvardiol, a place on the bench, where he was accompanied by another fresh arrival, Mateo Kovacic, whose debut began after 24 minutes, in place of an injured De Bruyne – Guardiola later voicing concern. For a period City were disrupted, as suddenly Amdouni was bursting through and threatening Ederson’s goal – he overran the ball – and Lyle Foster was skipping along the left and serving up a cross begging for a colleague to gamble on and run onto. Haaland – who else – showed what was required as City, again, showed no mercy before goal. Kyle Walker’s pullback to Julián Álvarez was fed to the Norwegian and he pinged the ball home off the bar. This muted Burnley and gave their crowd an illustration of why the champions are so good, even though Guardiola, as is his fashion, strode off upbraiding Haaland for some misdemeanour, his anger shown by shoving away the camera that filmed this incident. Burnley administered pretty touches and launched raids along the flanks, where Vitinho troubled Aké and Walker. But City were able to contain the hosts. Their next foray was a Haaland attempt that earned a corner, yet soon they were pushed back needing Ederson’s out-ball to the centre-forward once more. There was definitely more of the aerial stuff on display from City than normal: Rodri rose at an Álvarez corner from the right and steered a header down into the turf and at goal. The last time Guardiola’s men played competitively they claimed the Champions League courtesy of the Spaniard’s winner and he decorated this contest, too, with his blend of smart holding play and schemer’s eye for any openings ahead. Álvarez could have used a touch of Rodri’s vision when scampering through and shooting wide as Rico Lewis, on the far side, was the far better option. Burnley, when able, were a type of mini-City, harrying the opponent near goal, hoping to squeeze the ball back and create a chance. But always Ederson, Walker, Aké, Rodri and Akanji were too slick to be mugged this way. Rodri smashed in a third that sealed the three points, which was an apt finale for City, who by the end had Gvardiol on the pitch for a bow in his new colours. Burnley, meanwhile, ended with Anass Zaroury being given a straight red card for a challenge on Walker after the referee had checked the pitchside monitor."
